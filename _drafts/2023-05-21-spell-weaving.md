description: A house rule that allows casters to modify spells on the fly at risk to the caster.
---
The untamed forces of magic in Dungeons and Dragons have long held the power to both awe and terrify, a duality echoed in the narrative threads of fantasy literature. This house rule invites players to embrace this paradox, offering a high-stakes opportunity to amplify their spells beyond conventional limits. But, this isn't a risk to be taken lightly; mastery comes with potential for both magnificent success and cataclysmic failure. This high-risk, high-reward dynamic is not universal, but rather tethered to Places of Power - locations within the game world steeped in raw, wild magical energy. Here, spellcasters can attempt to weave this abundant power into their own spells, pushing the boundaries of what they could usually achieve. However, the road to arcane supremacy is fraught with peril, and the volatile energies of these places can lead to unexpected and dangerous consequences.

As a Dungeon Master, this house rule offers a unique narrative tool to manage the use of these amplified abilities and build compelling encounters. Villains, drawn to the immense power offered by these locations, might set up their lairs in Places of Power, adding an extra layer of challenge and strategy to confrontations. Moreover, these magical nexuses can become focal points in your campaign, driving the narrative as players might actively seek these places out, eager to tap into their vast potential. This is not just a rule - it is a lore, a plot device, and a tantalizing challenge all rolled into one, offering new avenues for character development and world-building. Embark on this arcane journey, and let your game be infused with the volatile and awe-inspiring power of raw magic.

## Places of Power

Places of Power are distinctive locations saturated with arcane or divine energies. A competent spellcaster can tap into these energies, enhancing their own spells and abilities. To utilize a Place of Power, a spellcaster must first identify a location that aligns with their specific magical or divine influence. Following discovery, the caster must engage in a period of study and attunement to effectively harness the location's power.

Here are the common types of Places of Power:

* **Leyline Nodes:** Leyline Nodes serve as focal points where natural currents of arcane energy converge, forming reservoirs of magical energy. Wizards can utilize these nodes, but only if their school of magic aligns with the particular energy of the node.

* **Holy Sites:** These locations bear a distinct significance to a specific god, religion, or holy ideal. Clerics can tap into these sites, provided their divine domain aligns with the site's sacred affiliation.

* **Primal Refuges:** These are areas that brim with the untouched, primal energies of nature, drawing power directly from the Feywild. Druids can utilize these refuges, but their Circle must align with the refuge's primal energy.

* **Pure Essence:** These locations have been previously inhabited by potent supernatural entities, and their residual essence remains infused within these places. Sorcerers can tap into these locations, but their bloodline must correspond to the essence of the entity that once inhabited the location.

## Spell Weaving

**Prerequisite:**
A Wizard, Cleric, Druid, or Sorcerer may attempt to weave spells starting at 5th level, provided their primary spell casting ability score is 15 or higher.

**Mechanic:**

As part of casting a spell, the character may attempt to enhance or modify the form by selecting one more more Metamagic-like effects. To do so by making a primary spell casting ability check. The difficulty class (DC) of this check is 10 + twice the level of spell being cast + 2 per Metamagic effect.

**Success:**

If the caster succeeds on the Arcana check, they successfully apply a Metamagic-like effect to  spell. The caster may choose from either Distant Spell, Empower Spell. Extended Spell, Empower Spell, or Subtle Spell. These work as per the description in the Sorcerers Class, exchanging using their primary spell casting ability wherever Charisma is mentioned.

**Failure:**

If the character fails the check, the spell fails and the caster loses the spell slot. Additionally, they suffer one randomly rolled spell failure plus one additional failure effect for every 5 points they fail the Check by. 

Roll a d6 to determine the type of failure:

**Spell Failure**

1. **Mana Burn:** The caster loses a spell slot of the spell's level. If they have no more spell slots of that level, the player may choose to lose a spell slot of the next highest level, or two slots from the level below - it's the player's choice. If none are available, roll again.
2. **Exhaustion:** The caster gains a level of exhaustion as they've overtaxed their body.
3. **Soul Shock:** The caster has disadvantage on all checks with their primary casting ability until they complete a long rest. Rolling this effect again extends the duration by one additional long rest.
4. **Sensory Overload:** The caster is blinded, deafened, or loses the ability to speak (player's choice) until the end of their next long rest. Rolling this effect again allows the player to select another effect or extends the duration of an existing effect by one additional long rest.
5. **System Shock:** The caster must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC 10 + spell level) or become stunned until the end of their next turn. Rolling this effect again means the condition lasts until the wizard makes a successful save, repeating this save at the end of each turn after the next. If this effect is rolled a 3rd time, roll again instead.
6. **Spell Release:** The spell is released uncontrolled and manifests in the world as a living spell with a malicious intent. It immediately attacks the spell caster and their allies.

As always, adjust this system as necessary to fit your campaign and your players' preferences.
