Part 2

### Group Roles

#### Guide
**Guides** choose the route for a party, who depend on them for their knowledge of the terrain ahead to avoid danger or stay on the right path. At the start of each travel day, the Guide rolls either Intelligence (Nature) or Intelligence (History) at the DC associated with the appropriate terrain.  A failure on this roll means the pace for the day is one level slower due to unforseen doubling back, blockages, or other obstacles. If the Guide doesn't have appropriate maps or knowledge of the specific terrain ahead, this roll is made at disadvantage.  If the terrain could be considered their home territory, the roll is made with advantage.
