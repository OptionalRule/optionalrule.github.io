Earlier this year, I wrote about a house rule for adding a more [gritty injury system to 5th Edition D&D]({ link _posts/2024-02-16-revised-exhausted-condition.md}), inspired by the proposed changes to exhaustion in the revised playtest material. With the release of the 2024 edition, we now have the final set of modified rules for exhaustion. Let's revisit our gritty injury system and see how we can adapt it to these new official rules.

## The New Exhaustion Rules

The 2024 edition of D&D has given us the following rules for exhaustion:

> **Exhaustion [Condition]**
> 
> While you have the Exhaustion condition, you experience the following effects:
> 
> - **Exhaustion Levels:** This condition is cumulative. Each time you receive it, you gain 1 Exhaustion level. You die if your Exhaustion level is 6.
> - **D20 Tests Affected:** When you make a D20 Test, the roll is reduced by 2 times your Exhaustion level.
> - **Speed Reduced:** Your Speed is reduced by a number of feet equal to 5 times your Exhaustion level.
> - **Removing Exhaustion Levels:** Finishing a Long Rest removes 1 of your Exhaustion levels. When your Exhaustion level reaches 0, the condition ends.

These rules are more potent than the original proposed rules in the playtest. They still maintain the six-level limit before character death but carry a heavier penalty of -2 per level of exhaustion.

## Adapting Our Gritty Injury System

The core philosophy behind our original house rules for using Exhaustion still applies, but we need to consider some additional factors:

1. **Granting Exhaustion:** Given the higher penalties and lower death threshold, DMs should carefully consider under what conditions they grant exhaustion. I recommend two options, depending on the desired tone and feel of the game:

   a) For survivalist games: Grant a level of exhaustion every time a player hits 0 HP. This creates a significant sense of urgency as players' hit points dwindle. However, some players might find this too punishing.

   b) For a grittier feel that enhances action: Grant a level of exhaustion on the first failed death save after reaching 0 HP. This maintains urgency when a character falls while keeping the focus on gameplay options. 

2. **Class Abilities:** As in our original house rules, I suggest allowing fighters to burn a use of Action Surge to shake off a level of exhaustion. This gives these hardy warriors a unique way to push through their limits. Barbarians already get to ignore the effects of exhaustion when raging, so this option is a good compromise for them. Paladins and Ranger will eventually gain access to Lesser Restoration, which removes one level of exhaustion, so this option is also a good compromise for them. The Monk's Uncanny Metabolism feature should also be allowed to remove exhaustion.

3. **Spell Modifications:** The PHB 2024 rules require a 5th-level spell (Greater Restoration) to remove one level of exhaustion. I recommend modifying this to allow Lesser Restoration to remove a level of Exhaustion and Greater Restoration to heal all levels. This house rule could be beneficial even without using the full Gritty Injury System.

## Balancing Act: Grit vs. Fun

When implementing these house rules, it's crucial to strike a balance between creating a sense of danger and maintaining player enjoyment. Here are some additional considerations:

- **Communicate clearly:** Ensure your players understand these rules before implementing them. Discuss the intended impact on gameplay and be open to feedback.
- **Monitor closely:** Pay attention to how these rules affect your game. Are players enjoying the added tension, or does it feel too punishing?
- **Be flexible:** Don't hesitate to adjust the rules if they're not achieving the desired effect. You might need to tweak the conditions for gaining exhaustion or the methods of recovery.
- **Provide alternatives:** Consider introducing more readily available healing items or abilities that can mitigate exhaustion to give players additional strategic options.

## Conclusion

Revisiting our Gritty Injury System in light of the new 2024 D&D rules allows us to refine our approach to creating a more dangerous and tactically rich game world. By carefully implementing these modified exhaustion rules, we can enhance the sense of risk and reward in our campaigns without overwhelming our players.

Remember, the goal is to create memorable, exciting adventures where every decision matters. Used judiciously, these rules can help foster a game where victory is all the sweeter for the challenges overcome along the way.
