summary: A breakdown the often missunderstood Advantage mechanic in Dunegeons & Dragons.

Advantage and Disadvantage is an easy to use but surprisingly missunderstood mechanic in 5th edition Dungeons & Dragons. While easy to apply, it's not always apparent how how it interacts with subsystems or even how the statistics actually work. Some time back I ranked different bonus types in my article on [Tools for Effecting Rolls]({% post_url 2021-01-02-tools-for-effecting-rolls-in-dd %}). In the article I ranked the impact various bonuses have on success, but there is more to the story. It's also important to understsand how DCs, bounded accuracy, criticals, Halfling Luck, and more interact with Advantage.
