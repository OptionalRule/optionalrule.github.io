Advantage and Disadvantage is a surprisingly easy, yet diseptivley dynamic system in 5th edition Dungeons & Dragons. While easy to apply, it's not always apparent how it stacks up against other bonus or penalties. Several months back I ranked different bonus types in my article on [Tools for Effecting Rolls]({% post_url 2021-01-02-tools-for-effecting-rolls-in-dd %}). In this article, I want to examime the actual results and outcomes in a bit more depth and discuss how it's releveant to encounter design. Specifically, how some of these options can be great tools in the DMs toolbag to raise tension, without needlessly effecting the players.
