summary: Adding journey actions to make travel exciting again in 5th edition Dungeons & Dragons.
---

Exciting journeys in 5th edition engage the party and give them meaningful actions as part of the adventure.  Last week I posted [Perilous Journey's Part 1]({% link _posts/2021-07-13-perilous-journeys-in-5e-p1.md %}), which turns travel into a series of encounters like any other dungeon. This week, I'll look at defining some ways that party members can take meaningful actions during journeys.  These **Journey Actions** provide gameplay for the travel experience, as well as create dependencies between members of the party. 

As with any rule or option, use where were appropriate and move along when they don't add anything to the experience.

## Journey Actions

When traveling, a character may take one Journey Action as part of travel.  Any actions taken during travel should be selected prior to the start of travel.  

Multiple characters may attempt the same action and each roll separetly. This has the same roll mechanic as advantage but they each apply their individual skill bonus.

The DM may want to consider the role of proficiency in these rules. Optionally, they may only allow a character to take a Journey action if proficient in the indicated skills. 

**Terrain Pace and DC Table** 

| Pace    | Speed | Daily | DC |Terrain                |
|---------|:-----:|:-----:|:--:|-----------------------|
| Fast    | 4 mph | 32 mi | -  |-                      |
| Normal  | 3 mph | 24 mi | 10 |Grasslands, plains, wastes etc.|
| Slow    | 2 mph | 16 mi | 15 |Forests, hills, tundra, sand desert, etc.    |
| Crawl   | 1 mph | 8 mi  | 20 |Mountains, swamps, jungle, etc. |

### Forage

Foraging along the way for harvestables plants, or small game allows parties to eat hearty means.  Rather than keeping track of day to day rations in a group, this form of foraging gathers ingrediants for a **Hearty Meal**.  As mentioned in, part 1 of Perilous Journeys, a hearty meal may allow characters to recover a single hit die from after sleeping for eight hours when unable to take a long rest.

Characters harvesting use the rules in Chapter 5 of the PHB and roll ***Wisdom (Survival)***, at +5 DC to the table presented there. Again, with this method assume the party has enough food to sustain themselves and recover exhaustion.  Instead, this type fo foraging focuses on higher quality food to help recover Hit Die as per the rules above.

### Guide
Guiding a party involves combining your knowledge of an areas geography, history, and conditions to choose a safe and sure route. At the start of a day's journey, the guide decides the best route and rolls either an ***Intelligence (Nature)*** or ***Intelligence (History)*** check at the DC presented on the Terrain Pace table. This roll is made with disadvantage if the guide is unfamiliar with the terrain, has no maps, or has not gathered enough information prior to travel.

<strong><em>Note on Survival Skill:</em></strong> While the survival skill will keep you oriented in the right direction it does not give you any foreknowlege of the conditions or geography ahead. (Terrain DC or move one pace slower, + 1 hour travel for every 5 they succeed by).{: .alert .alert-info}

### Scout
Scouting involves moving ahead of the party and using your keen senses and stealth to spot or avoid danger.  Scouts may always make active ***Wisdom (Perception)*** checks against hidden dangers.  Additionally they can use their ***Dexterity (Stealth)*** skill to allow the entire party to avoid an encounter if the scout spotted it first. Parties staging an ambush on foes discovered by a scout have advantage on checks to catch them unaware.

### Steward

### Ward
Warding uses prowess and awareness to protect the party from hazzards and ambush. If a character in the party performing the warding action is not surprised during an ambush, the entire party gets advantage on their roll to avoid surprise. 

Also, when encountering a natural hazzard that requires a Strength or Dexterity save, the Warder may roll ***Strength (Athletics)*** and allow a character up to 10 feet away to use that roll instead of their own save.  The warding character may allow a number of characters up to their proficiency bonus to use their roll in this way. Examples of the kinds of hazzards might be falling, avoiding an avalance, stepping into a pit or the like.

## Spicing Things Up

These rules mix well with a number of other house rules. By themselves they are not any more deadly or gritty than any dungeon encounter. In fact, these rules really only bring journey encounters in alignment with dungeons and other main types of encounters. You can think of the entire track of a journey like a node based set of encounters in a dungeon.

Mixing in other rules such as slower hitpoint recovery, or failed death saves only clearing on a long-rest, should be approached with caution with a system like this. 

Additionally, consider adding more opportunities for players to interact with locals during travel. Perhaps a well to do farmer would allow the party to sleep in their comfortable barn with food or supplies, or the rules might drive the party to seek out more Inns.  The goal is to spice up journeys with more meaningful actions and choices, so encourage players to lean into that.

## Conclusion

These actions and rules imply a healthy variety of hazzards and challenges during Journeys, but DMs should use their descretion. Not every journey need be a gripping adventure, and DMs may choose to pass several days at a time rather than going day by day. Choose the style that best fits the pacing and style of the game in the moment. There are a number of wilderness encounter generators available on the DMs Guild, as well as sites like DnDSpeak.com that offer lots of encounter ideas and tables.  I will eventually post systems here for journey based encounters as well.
