description: Dive into D&D's magic with our guide on Places of Power. Explore how to find, attune, and harness these unique locations to enhance spellcasting!

The untamed forces of magic in Dungeons and Dragons have long held the power to both awe and terrify, a duality echoed in the narrative threads of fantasy literature. This house rule invites players to embrace this paradox, offering a high-stakes opportunity to amplify their spells beyond conventional limits. But, this isn't a risk to be taken lightly; mastery comes with potential for both magnificent success and cataclysmic failure. This high-risk, high-reward dynamic is not universal, but rather tethered to Places of Power - locations within the game world steeped in raw, wild magical energy. Here, spellcasters can attempt to weave this abundant power into their own spells, pushing the boundaries of what they could usually achieve. However, the road to arcane supremacy is fraught with peril, and the volatile energies of these places can lead to unexpected and dangerous consequences.

As a Dungeon Master, this house rule offers a unique narrative tool to manage the use of these amplified abilities and build compelling encounters. Villains, drawn to the immense power offered by these locations, might set up their lairs in Places of Power, adding an extra layer of challenge and strategy to confrontations. Moreover, these magical nexuses can become focal points in your campaign, driving the narrative as players might actively seek these places out, eager to tap into their vast potential. This is not just a rule - it is a lore, a plot device, and a tantalizing challenge all rolled into one, offering new avenues for character development and world-building. Embark on this arcane journey, and let your game be infused with the volatile and awe-inspiring power of raw magic.

## Places of Power

Places of Power are distinctive locations saturated with arcane or divine energies. A competent spellcaster can tap into these energies, enhancing their own spells and abilities. To utilize a Place of Power, a spellcaster must first identify a location that aligns with their specific magical or divine influence. Following discovery, the caster must engage in a period of study and attunement to effectively harness the location's power.

Here are the common types of Places of Power:

* **Leyline Nodes:** Leyline Nodes serve as focal points where natural currents of arcane energy converge, forming reservoirs of magical energy. Wizards can utilize these nodes, but only if their school of magic aligns with the particular energy of the node.

* **Holy Sites:** These locations bear a distinct significance to a specific god, religion, or holy ideal. Clerics can tap into these sites, provided their divine domain aligns with the site's sacred affiliation.

* **Primal Refuges:** These are areas that brim with the untouched, primal energies of nature, drawing power directly from the Feywild. Druids can utilize these refuges, but their Circle must align with the refuge's primal energy.

* **Pure Essence:** These locations have been previously inhabited by potent supernatural entities, and their residual essence remains infused within these places. Sorcerers can tap into these locations, but their bloodline must correspond to the essence of the entity that once inhabited the location.

## Finding and Attuning to a Place of Power
Places of power may be detected with the Detect Magic spell. Alternatively a combination of a study of the history of the place or careful examination may allow a History or Investigation check to realize a location is a place of power.

Once discovered, a spellcaster can take a short rest and attempt to attune to a Place of Power by making a check using their primary spellcasting ability. The DC for this check is set by the DM and typically ranges from 10 for common or well-known Places of Power, to 20 or more for extremely rare or unique locations. Importantly, attuning to a location does not count against the character's maximum item attunement limit. However, this attunement isn't permanent and may fade over time, necessitating reattunement after a significant period.

Remember, Places of Power should be treated as significant elements within your world, and their discovery and utilization should carry corresponding narrative weight.

## Effects
Places of Power in D&D can enhance, modify or even provide entirely new abilities, offering a boost to spellcasters and creatures alike. DMs are encouraged to get creative with the effects of these power locations, making their campaigns even more engaging. Many wizards position their towers, creatures make lairs, and churches build their foundations upon these mystical spots, all seeking to harness their power. 

Places of Power have a rarity system, akin to that of magic items, ranging from Common to Legendary. Here's a brief overview of each category:

1. **Common:** These Places of Power are frequently encountered, and their effects, while beneficial, are relatively minor. Examples might include an area providing something akin to the Guidance spell or Song of Rest ability once per day. Roadside inns, small shrines, and minor monster lairs often occupy these sites.

2. **Uncommon:** Less common than their counterparts, these Places of Power provide slightly more potent effects or a broader range of minor effects. Typical examples might include Spell Weaving (see below), halving the time of spell scribing or alchemical production, providing an extra hit die of healing during a short rest once a day, or a small bonus to attack. Large shrines or small chapels, houses of healing, fortifications, libraries, and lairs often occupy these sites.

3. **Rare:** Rare Places of Power are challenging to find, but their beneficial effects are considerably more potent and impactful. Typical effects might include providing an increase to hit points, resistance to a type of damage, sustaining low-level spell effects, doubling healing, and more. Churches, organizational headquarters, strong castles, and powerful monster lairs often occupy these sites.

4. **Very Rare:** These Places of Power are seldom encountered. Their effects are significantly powerful, offering substantial benefits to those able to tap into them. These sites may provide regeneration, multiple resistances, spell resistance, control of regional weather, and more. Grand temples, state capitals, powerful citadels, and ancient dragon lairs often occupy these sites.

5. **Legendary:** The most elusive of all, Legendary Places of Power offer truly awe-inspiring and mind-bending abilities. They're often tied to significant historical or world events and form the stuff of myths and legends. These sites provide total damage resistance or some damage immunities, combinations of spell-like abilities, the ability to alter terrain or control animals or beings in the region. Locations are almost always unique and heavily contested, leaving a legacy of woe.

The possibilities are truly limitless, and Dungeon Masters are encouraged to get creative. Perhaps these locations house portals, serve as communion points for Warlocks and their patrons, or even provide coveted power sources for diligent Wizards. They could also imbue lair-dwelling monsters with abilities they might not typically possess. Use these Places of Power to enhance your game, provide players with intriguing new goals and mysteries, and above all, enjoy the journey. Gear up to elevate your gaming experience!

### Spell Weaving (Uncommon)

When a spellcaster is within an attuned Place of Power, they may tap into its energy to enhance their spellcasting. As part of casting a spell, the caster can choose add one or more Metamagic-like effects. To do so, the caster must make a spellcasting ability check. The DC for this check is 10 + the level of the spell being cast + 2 for each Metamagic effect selected.

The available effects at a Place of Power typically include Distant Spell, Empower Spell, Extended Spell, and Subtle Spell, as per the descriptions provided in the Sorcerer class, but with references to Charisma replaced by the caster's primary spellcasting ability.

If the character fails the check, the spell fails and the caster loses the spell slot. Additionally, if they fail the roll by 5 or more, they suffer one randomly rolled spell failure plus one additional failure effect for every additional 5 points they fail the Check by. 

Roll a d6 to determine the type of failure:

**Spell Failure**

1. **Mana Burn:** The caster loses a spell slot of the spell's level. If they have no more spell slots of that level, the player may choose to lose a spell slot of the next highest level, or two slots from the level below - it's the player's choice. If none are available, roll again.
2. **Exhaustion:** The caster gains a level of exhaustion as they've overtaxed their body.
3. **Soul Shock:** The caster has disadvantage on all checks with their primary casting ability until they complete a long rest. Rolling this effect again extends the duration by one additional long rest.
4. **Sensory Overload:** The caster is blinded, deafened, or loses the ability to speak (player's choice) until the end of their next long rest. Rolling this effect again allows the player to select another effect or extends the duration of an existing effect by one additional long rest.
5. **System Shock:** The caster must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC 10 + spell level) or become stunned until the end of their next turn. Rolling this effect again means the condition lasts until the wizard makes a successful save, repeating this save at the end of each turn. If this effect is rolled a 3rd time, roll again instead.
6. **Mana Feedback:** The caster takes 1d8 force damage per level of the spell they attempted to cast.

As always, adjust this system as necessary to fit your campaign and your players' preferences.

#### Sorcerer Metamagic in a Place of Power

When a sorcerer attuned to a Place of Power uses a Metamagic ability, they reduce the Sorcery Point cost by 1. If this adjustment would bring the cost below 1, there's still a 50% chance they expend 1 Sorcery Point. Sorcerers can choose to use the standard Place of Power rules instead, particularly if they're out of Sorcery Points or willing to embrace the risk.
