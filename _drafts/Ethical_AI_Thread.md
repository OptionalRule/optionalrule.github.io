Out of curiosity I threw a couple of your questions into ChatGPT.

Summarize the history of the city of Waterdeep


Spoiler
Waterdeep, also known as the "City of Splendors," is a major port city in the Forgotten Realms, a fictional world in the Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) universe. It is one of the most influential and largest cities on the Sword Coast of Faerûn, known for its rich history, diverse population, and political intrigue.

Origins and Founding
Waterdeep's history stretches back thousands of years, predating its modern incarnation. It originally started as a humble fishing village, inhabited by small groups of humans and non-human races. Its strategic location, along the coast and at the crossroads of many trade routes, soon led to its growth and importance. Over time, the village developed into a more structured settlement and became a gathering point for adventurers, merchants, and settlers. It grew significantly when human settlers came into conflict with other races, including the elves of nearby Ardeep Forest and the orcs of the Spine of the World mountains. The city's history has been marked by a series of wars, notably against orcs and other invaders.

Rise of Waterdeep
By the Year of the Curse (1032 DR), Ahghairon, a powerful wizard, rose to prominence and became the first Lord of Waterdeep. He established the system of governance by masked lords, an oligarchy that ruled anonymously, protecting the city from personal vendettas and ensuring fairness. Ahghairon's magic and leadership stabilized Waterdeep, fostering a period of growth and prosperity. Over the centuries, Waterdeep became a thriving hub for trade, magic, and culture. Its influence spread along the Sword Coast and beyond, making it a key player in regional politics. Adventurers from around Faerûn were drawn to the city due to its proximity to dungeons and ruins, particularly Undermountain, a vast labyrinth beneath the city filled with monsters, treasure, and ancient secrets.

Recent History and Modern Waterdeep
In modern times, Waterdeep is one of the largest and wealthiest cities in the Forgotten Realms, boasting a cosmopolitan population that includes humans, elves, dwarves, gnomes, and even more exotic races. Its political landscape is defined by the Open Lord, a public figurehead, and the Masked Lords, whose identities are secret. The city is also home to powerful factions like the Harpers, the Zhentarim, and the Lords' Alliance, all vying for influence. The city’s history is intertwined with the presence of Waterdeep's powerful guilds, temples, and noble houses. The Lords of Waterdeep, including the mysterious Masked Lords, maintain order through a mix of diplomacy, magic, and military power. The city remains a center for commerce, adventuring, and arcane studies, with institutions like Blackstaff Tower and the Yawning Portal serving as key locations for magical research and exploration. Waterdeep’s significance as a trade and cultural center remains unmatched in Faerûn, and it continues to be a focal point in many D&D campaigns and stories."

Problem is being produced by AI I've no way of knowing what is accurate, that it has pulled form information on the internet, and what it just made up because it suits the fantasy world of D&D. It all seems plausible, and my knowledge of the setting isn't deep enough to know what might be inaccurate. Looking up the wizards they seem to be existing characters but not all current or necessarily about at the same period.

I wonder about the ethics of something like the above, and copyright issues. Both results are clearly pulling information gathered from what is available on the internet on various wikis (often produced by fans), but what is available on the internet is pulling from originally copyrighted works. How much has been significantly transformed from say The Forgotten Realms Campaign guide? And if copyright is being broken who is breaking the copyright ChatGPT or the fan wiki, both? Why is the AI search and worse than an old fashioned google search and visiting the fan wiki?
