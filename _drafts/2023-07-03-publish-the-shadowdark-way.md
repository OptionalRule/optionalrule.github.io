# Fonts
To find fonts used in a PDF just open the target PDF in Adobe Reader, then go to File > Properties.  There you will see a Fonts tab that lists all the fonts. 

The fonts used in the official Shadowdark TTRPG are:
- [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) - Part of Google Fonts online.
- [JSL-Blackletter](https://www.dafont.com/jsl-blackletter.font) - This font is used for section heads and title. It is freely available fonts at various locations online.  
- [Old Newspaper](https://www.dafont.com/old-newspaper-font.font) - Also used for headers etc.
