It’s a concept that periodically bubbles up in the tabletop role-playing game (TTRPG) community, like an ancient dragon in its cyclical slumber, and we seem to be in the midst of another awakening.</p>

<p>It’s no surprise that understanding HP often seems like trying to learn Draconic without a spell of Comprehend Languages. Table Top Roleplaying Games are narrative adventures, so we naturally want to weave a compelling story around every game element. And therein lies the enigma of Hit Points - no matter how you narrate them, you’re likely to walk into a wall of confusion and pile of contradictions.</p>

<h2 id="a-historical-perspective">A Historical Perspective</h2>

<p>Many D&amp;D elements, including HP, sprung from the hobby’s wargaming roots. In those days, units usually had a defensive score and an offensive score. The outcomes were binary: units either lived or died. But when these concepts morphed into the individual tactical combat that defined Original D&amp;D (OD&amp;D), there was a need for a way to track the progress towards defeat, thus giving birth to Armor Class (AC) and Hit Points (HP).</p>

<p>In OD&amp;D, AC denoted how challenging you were to hit, and HP showed how close you were to defeat. The game simply states, “Your hit points determine how hard your character is to kill.” And that’s it. That’s the HP origin story. They’re an arbitrary, abstract measurement of how difficult you are to kill and how far along the game is in achieving that.</p>

<h2 id="the-evolution-of-hp">The Evolution of HP</h2>

<p>Later D&amp;D editions got increasingly philosophical about HP. Advanced D&amp;D acknowledged physical punishment, but clarified that “a significant portion of hit points, especially at higher levels, stands for skill, luck, and/or magical factors.” It even said it would be “ridiculous” to assume characters could endure such physical punishment, further emphasizing that HP are not intended to be taken literally.</p>

<p>2nd Edition D&amp;D kept the abstract theme, defining damage as an abstract concept that allows characters to be heroic. It didn’t dwell on the semantics of HP. 3rd Edition, on the other hand, leaned into the mechanics and didn’t provide a narrative explanation for HP and damage at all. 4th Edition tried to have the best of both worlds, setting a base number of hit points representing “real” damage, while anything over was the old dance of skill, luck, and magic.</p>

<p>By the time 5th edition D&amp;D came around, we’re back in the abstract realm, with the game stating, “Hit Points represent a combination of physical and mental durability, the will to live, and luck.”</p>

<h2 id="hit-points-setting-the-stage-not-defining-the-genre">Hit Points: Setting the Stage, Not defining the Genre</h2>

<p>Hit Point mechanics are integral, but the presence of HP doesn’t force your game into a specific genre. That job is for the Dungeon Master, who tailors how this mechanic comes into play. For instance, early D&amp;D editions painted a grim, risky scene with low HP and tight damage thresholds, providing a sword-and-sorcery feel. In contrast, 5th Edition, with its generous HP pools and high-damage exploits, resonates with high-fantasy heroics.</p>

<p>Remember, it’s not the existence of HP that set these styles; it’s their application. As the DM, you have the freedom to adjust this tool to shape your campaign’s tone, from injecting grimdark elements into a 5th Edition game by reducing HP, to amping up the heroics in a 1st Edition game by increasing HP totals. At the end of the day, HP is a vital but flexible aspect of the D&amp;D universe.</p>

<h2 id="hit-points-tools-not-shackles">Hit Points: Tools, Not Shackles</h2>

<p>It’s crucial to remember that Hit Points are a mechanic, not a set of shackles for the DM. They have their boundaries and are not designed to simulate everything could befall a character. Every edition of D&amp;D underscores this, suggesting that the DM delineates these limits.</p>

<p>For instance, if a character decides to take a dip in a lava pool or plunge from a mile-high cliff, many DMs might opt not to roll damage, deeming these situations unsurvivable. In such cases, the official material often advises DMs to declare character death outright, instead of getting tangled in the mire of damage dice. <em>However, if these drastic scenarios occur frequently in your game, it might be worth reassessing your game design.</em></p>

<p>On the flip side, some DMs might channel a superhero vibe, letting characters brush off falls from great heights. That’s equally valid. As with any ruling in a tabletop RPG, maintaining an internally consistent world is the important part.</p>

<p>The bottom line? Understanding the tone of your game and setting appropriate limits is key when navigating the world of Hit Points. Keep this in mind as you weave your epic tales of adventure.</p>

<h2 id="living-with-the-hp-conundrum">Living with the HP Conundrum</h2>

<p>Trying to define Hit Points is like grappling with a Mind Flayer — it’s a sure path to madness. Make it too abstract, and you create a narrative disconnect. Make it too literal, and you grapple with the absurdities of surviving a lava bath or healing from the brink of death overnight.</p>

<p>In my humble opinion, D&amp;D intends for players to embrace the vagueness of Hit Points. They’re not ‘meat points’ or a measure of your plot armor, but more an abstraction of your character’s struggle to survive. Like most time travel plotlines, it’s nonsensical. So, just wave your hand, enjoy the game, and let the Hit Points fall where they may. Their purpose is to serve the adventure, the narrative, and ultimately, the fun. Because, in the end, who needs a physics lesson in the thermal dynamics of lava when you can have a daring escape from a volcano instead?</p>

This house rule invites players to embrace this paradox, offering a high-stakes opportunity to amplify their spells beyond conventional limits. But, this isn’t a risk to be taken lightly; mastery comes with potential for both magnificent success and cataclysmic failure. This high-risk, high-reward dynamic is not universal, but rather tethered to Places of Power - locations within the game world steeped in raw, wild magical energy. Here, spellcasters can attempt to weave this abundant power into their own spells, pushing the boundaries of what they could usually achieve. However, the road to arcane supremacy is fraught with peril, and the volatile energies of these places can lead to unexpected and dangerous consequences.</p>

<p>As a Dungeon Master, this house rule offers a unique narrative tool to manage the use of these amplified abilities and build compelling encounters. Villains, drawn to the immense power offered by these locations, might set up their lairs in Places of Power, adding an extra layer of challenge and strategy to confrontations. Moreover, these magical nexuses can become focal points in your campaign, driving the narrative as players might actively seek these places out, eager to tap into their vast potential. This is not just a rule - it is a lore, a plot device, and a tantalizing challenge all rolled into one, offering new avenues for character development and world-building. Embark on this arcane journey, and let your game be infused with the volatile and awe-inspiring power of raw magic.</p>

<h2 id="places-of-power">Places of Power</h2>

<p>Places of Power are distinctive locations saturated with arcane or divine energies. A competent spellcaster can tap into these energies, enhancing their own spells and abilities. To utilize a Place of Power, a spellcaster must first identify a location that aligns with their specific magical or divine influence. Following discovery, the caster must engage in a period of study and attunement to effectively harness the location’s power. Place types may or may not make a difference in terms of access and attunement, as determined by the DM.</p>

<p>Here are the common types of Places of Power:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Leyline Nodes:</strong> Leyline Nodes serve as focal points where natural currents of arcane energy converge, forming reservoirs of magical energy. Wizards can utilize these nodes, but only if their school of magic aligns with the particular energy of the node.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Holy Sites:</strong> These locations bear a distinct significance to a specific god, religion, or holy ideal. Clerics can tap into these sites, provided their divine domain aligns with the site’s sacred affiliation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Primal Refuges:</strong> These are areas that brim with the untouched, primal energies of nature, drawing power directly from the Feywild. Druids can utilize these refuges, but their Circle must align with the refuge’s primal energy.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Pure Essence:</strong> These locations have been previously inhabited by potent supernatural entities, and their residual essence remains infused within these places. Sorcerers can tap into these locations, but their bloodline must correspond to the essence of the entity that once inhabited the location.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="finding-and-attuning-to-a-place-of-power">Finding and Attuning to a Place of Power</h2>
<p>Places of power may be detected with the Detect Magic spell. Alternatively a combination of a study of the history of the place or careful examination may allow a History or Investigation check to realize a location is a place of power.</p>

<p>Once discovered, a spellcaster can take a short rest and attempt to attune to a Place of Power by making a check using their primary spellcasting ability. The DC for this check is set by the DM and typically ranges from 10 for common or well-known Places of Power, to 20 or more for extremely rare or unique locations. Importantly, attuning to a location does not count against the character’s maximum item attunement limit. However, this attunement isn’t permanent and may fade over time, necessitating reattunement after a significant period.</p>

<p>Remember, Places of Power should be treated as significant elements within your world, and their discovery and utilization should carry corresponding narrative weight.</p>

<h2 id="rarity--effects">Rarity &amp; Effects</h2>
<p>Places of Power in D&amp;D can enhance, modify or even provide entirely new abilities, offering a boost to spellcasters and creatures alike. DMs are encouraged to get creative with the effects of these power locations, making their campaigns even more engaging. Many wizards position their towers, creatures make lairs, and churches build their foundations upon these mystical spots, all seeking to harness their power.</p>

<p>Places of Power have a rarity system, akin to that of magic items, ranging from Common to Legendary. Here’s a brief overview of each category:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Common:</strong> These Places of Power are frequently encountered, and their effects, while beneficial, are relatively minor. Examples might include an area providing something akin to the Guidance spell or Song of Rest ability once per day. Roadside inns, small shrines, and minor monster lairs often occupy these sites.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Uncommon:</strong> Less common than their counterparts, these Places of Power provide slightly more potent effects or a broader range of minor effects. Typical examples might include Spell Weaving (see below), halving the time of spell scribing or alchemical production, providing an extra hit die of healing during a short rest once a day, or a small bonus to attack. Large shrines or small chapels, houses of healing, fortifications, libraries, and lairs often occupy these sites.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Rare:</strong> Rare Places of Power are challenging to find, but their beneficial effects are considerably more potent and impactful. Typical effects might include providing an increase to hit points, resistance to a type of damage, sustaining low-level spell effects, doubling healing, and more. Churches, organizational headquarters, strong castles, and powerful monster lairs often occupy these sites.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Very Rare:</strong> These Places of Power are seldom encountered. Their effects are significantly powerful, offering substantial benefits to those able to tap into them. These sites may provide regeneration, multiple resistances, spell resistance, control of regional weather, and more. Grand temples, state capitals, powerful citadels, and ancient dragon lairs often occupy these sites.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Legendary:</strong> The most elusive of all, Legendary Places of Power offer truly awe-inspiring and mind-bending abilities. They’re often tied to significant historical or world events and form the stuff of myths and legends. These sites provide total damage resistance or some damage immunities, combinations of spell-like abilities, the ability to alter terrain or control animals or beings in the region. Locations are almost always unique and heavily contested, leaving a legacy of woe.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The possibilities are truly limitless, and Dungeon Masters are encouraged to get creative. Perhaps these locations house portals, serve as communion points for Warlocks and their patrons, or even provide coveted power sources for diligent Wizards. They could also imbue lair-dwelling monsters with abilities they might not typically possess. Use these Places of Power to enhance your game, provide players with intriguing new goals and mysteries, and above all, enjoy the journey. Gear up to elevate your gaming experience!</p>

<h3 id="spell-weaving-uncommon">Spell Weaving (Uncommon)</h3>

<p>When a spellcaster is within an attuned Place of Power, they may tap into its energy to enhance their spellcasting. As part of casting a spell, the caster can choose add one or more Metamagic-like effects. To do so, the caster must make a spellcasting ability check. The DC for this check is 10 + the level of the spell being cast + 2 for each Metamagic effect selected.</p>

<p>The available effects at a Place of Power typically include Distant Spell, Empower Spell, Extended Spell, and Subtle Spell, as per the descriptions provided in the Sorcerer class, but with references to Charisma replaced by the caster’s primary spellcasting ability.</p>

<p>If the character fails the check, the spell fails and the caster loses the spell slot. Additionally, if they fail the roll by 5 or more, they suffer one randomly rolled spell failure plus one additional failure effect for every additional 5 points they fail the Check by.</p>

<p>Roll a d6 to determine the type of failure:</p>

<p><strong>Spell Failure</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Mana Burn:</strong> The caster loses a spell slot of the spell’s level. If they have no more spell slots of that level, the player may choose to lose a spell slot of the next highest level, or two slots from the level below - it’s the player’s choice. If none are available, roll again.</li>
  <li><strong>Exhaustion:</strong> The caster gains a level of exhaustion as they’ve overtaxed their body.</li>
  <li><strong>Soul Shock:</strong> The caster has disadvantage on all checks with their primary casting ability until they complete a long rest. Rolling this effect again extends the duration by one additional long rest.</li>
  <li><strong>Sensory Overload:</strong> The caster is blinded, deafened, or loses the ability to speak (player’s choice) until the end of their next long rest. Rolling this effect again allows the player to select another effect or extends the duration of an existing effect by one additional long rest.</li>
  <li><strong>System Shock:</strong> The caster must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC 10 + spell level) or become stunned until the end of their next turn. Rolling this effect again means the condition lasts until the wizard makes a successful save, repeating this save at the end of each turn. If this effect is rolled a 3rd time, roll again instead.</li>
  <li><strong>Mana Feedback:</strong> The caster takes 1d8 force damage per level of the spell they attempted to cast.</li>
</ol>

<p>As always, adjust this system as necessary to fit your campaign and your players’ preferences.</p>

<h4 id="sorcerer-metamagic-in-a-place-of-power">Sorcerer Metamagic in a Place of Power</h4>

<p>When a sorcerer attuned to a Place of Power uses a Metamagic ability, they reduce the Sorcery Point cost by 1. If this adjustment would bring the cost below 1, there’s still a 50% chance they expend 1 Sorcery Point. Sorcerers can choose to use the standard Place of Power rules instead, particularly if they’re out of Sorcery Points or willing to embrace the risk.</p>

Furthermore, those capable of raging can maintain their rage for an additional round without taking damage or attacking an opponent, their resolve empowered by the steadfast spirit of the cavern.</p>

One such overlooked provision, nestled within Chapter 9 of the DMG, is the “Mark” option. This rule, seemingly promising on the surface, is burdened with unnecessary complexities, offering marginal benefit.</p>

<figure class="figure float-end ms-4 clearfix">
    
    <img class="img-fluid figure-img " src="/assets/img/OpportunityAttack_480x720.jpg" alt="A fighter slashing at the back of an enemy as they run away. Black and white line art." height="720" width="480" />
    
    
        <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">No Running!</figcaption>
    
</figure>

<p>The original Mark option requires a character to ‘mark’ a target each turn and diligently keep track of this choice. The upside? The ability to execute an Opportunity Attack without consuming a reaction - a beneficial yet sporadic occurrence. However, the tediousness of marking a target every round, coupled with the relative rarity of Opportunity Attacks, seems needlessly complex and limiting, making this rule an unwieldy addition to many campaigns.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, with a sprinkle of creativity and modification, we believe this rule harbors the potential to significantly enhance the gameplay experience, especially for martial characters. Here, we propose a tweak aimed at simplifying the Mark option and boosting its relevance in melee combat dynamics:</p>

<blockquote class="d-flex flex-column rule simple-rule">
  <h2 id="mark-improved">Mark (Improved)</h2>
  <p>This option amplifies the capability of melee combatants to challenge each other with opportunity attacks.</p>

  <p>An Opportunity Attack against a creature that the attacker has struck with a Melee Attack since their last turn does not consume the attacker’s reaction. Characters are still limited to one Opportunity Attack per round.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This alteration doesn’t bog down gameplay with added choices, applies uniformly to all melee characters, provides the most substantial impact to characters with multiple attacks, and spares the added complexity of tracking marked targets. It retains the viability of Opportunity Attacks while synergizing well with abilities such as Protect, Intercept, Hide in Plain Sight, and many others, making martial characters, particularly fighters, far more dynamic.</p>

<p>That’s my take on this potential enhancement to the Mark rule, but what about you? Do you see the value this could bring to your game? We’re all ears for your thoughts, so let’s start a conversation.</p>]]></content><author><name>Scott Turnbull</name></author><category term="RPG Resources" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Explore a proposed revision to D&D 5E's "Mark" option to boost martial gameplay, simplifying rules and enriching combat dynamics.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://www.optionalrule.com/assets/img/OpportunityAttack_480x720.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://www.optionalrule.com/assets/img/OpportunityAttack_480x720.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Malevolent Monsters - The Mind Reaver</title><link href="https://www.optionalrule.com/2023/05/24/monster-mind-reaver/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Malevolent Monsters - The Mind Reaver" /><published>2023-05-24T08:43:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-05-24T08:43:00+00:00</updated><id>https://www.optionalrule.com/2023/05/24/monster-mind-reaver</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.optionalrule.com/2023/05/24/monster-mind-reaver/"><![CDATA[<p>In the thrilling realm of Dungeons &amp; Dragons, where weI’ve crafted epic battles and monstrous foes, I’m thrilled to introduce my latest creation, the Mind Reaver. This new entity is a nightmarish variation of the classic Mind Flayer. It’s not just a twisted iteration but an entirely different beast that thrives in chaos and malice, unlike its lawful evil kin. The Mind Reaver promises to surprise, challenge, and instill a sense of dread in even the most seasoned adventurers. As I bring this unpredictable creature into our stories, I aim to add another layer of depth to our collective adventures. So get ready, fellow Dungeon Masters and players, as we dive headlong into the chaotic and terrifying world of the Mind Reaver.</p>

<h2 id="the-mind-reaver">The Mind Reaver</h2>

<p>The process of creating a Mind Flayer is a precise and delicate one, carefully conducted by Illithid elders in their dark and hidden laboratories beneath the earth. However, when this procedure is tainted by volatile energies, the resulting creature is a grotesque and chaotic aberration known as a Mind Reaver.</p>

<p>Unlike their fully formed brethren, Mind Reavers bear the hideous marks of their flawed creation. Their bodies are twisted and warped, with elongated limbs, a disproportionate number of writhing tentacles, and skin mottled with pulsating patches of unnatural color. Their eyes, usually two in number, can vary in placement and quantity, giving them an unsettling gaze that seems to penetrate into one’s very soul.</p>

<h3 id="lore">Lore</h3>

<p>Mind Reavers are an anathema within Illithid society. Their chaotic tendencies make them unpredictable and dangerously volatile, both to enemies and their own kind. As such, they are typically exiled upon their creation, sent to wander the Underdark or any place far from the organized colonies of the Mind Flayers.</p>

<p>Though they lack the refined psionic prowess of a typical Mind Flayer, these creatures are not to be underestimated. Their chaotic nature fuels a raw, unrestrained psychic power, making them erratic but potent foes. This, coupled with their innate bitterness towards a world that has rejected them, makes them exceedingly dangerous.</p>

<p>It’s rumored that these creatures, despite their volatile and chaotic behavior, hold a profound hatred for their fully-formed Illithid brethren, and tales speak of them rallying other Underdark denizens to their cause. In rare instances, they have been known to form aberrant ‘colonies’ of their own, bringing together various misfit and outcast creatures of the Underdark under their warped rule.</p>

<p>In the end, the Mind Reaver is a tragic figure. Born of a process meant to create perfection, they are instead left as imperfect beings in a world that shuns them. Yet it’s this imperfection, this deviation from the norm, that makes them a force to be reckoned with. One should be wary when traversing the dark recesses of the Underdark, for you never know when you might cross paths with a Mind Reaver.</p>

<h2 id="using--mind-reavers">Using  Mind Reavers</h2>
<p>The Mind Reaver, with its Challenge Rating (CR) of 5, serves as an ideal boss monster for low-level parties or as a group threat for more advanced players. It embodies the very essence of malevolent chaos, destruction, resentment, and bitter betrayal, providing a gripping and intense encounter in any campaign. Whether it’s the primary antagonist in a dark story arc or a surprise menace lurking in the depths of your dungeon, the Mind Reaver promises an unforgettable encounter.</p>

In 2019, I found myself drawn to the city of Vathirond, tucked away in far eastern Breeland, on the fringes of Eberron's haunting Mournlands. With the Brey River's southern bank underfoot and the specter of the Gray Mist as a backdrop, Vathirond was an irresistible canvas for my homebrew campaign. Yet, as fate would have it, our journey through this enigmatic city was cut short due to the COVID pandemic. Now, after a couple of years, I've dusted off my notes and decided to share them with the world. Whether you're a seasoned Dungeon Master or a curious reader, I hope you find these glimpses into Vathirond - the city on the edge of the Mournlands - as fascinating as I did while crafting them.
</div>

<p>Situated amidst the low, rolling hills of the northern Dunvar Valley, the city of Vathirond was once a vibrant hub of creativity and artistry, where inspiration flowed as freely as the wind. The city, renowned across Khorvaire for its extravagant displays of artistic prowess, was known to entice artists and creators from all corners of the continent. They were drawn not only by the vibrancy of Vathirond’s culture but also by the city’s minor manifest zone to Xoriat, the plane of madness, which imbued the city with an aura of wild inspiration.</p>

        <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">The Crown of Masks</figcaption>
    
</figure>

<p>However, the Last War has left the city a shadow of its former self, its once-gleaming Crowns now scarred by conflict and its streets haunted by memories of a brighter past. The Mournlands loom ominously on the eastern horizon, a stark, ever-present reminder of the devastation wrought by the Last War. From the city’s highest points, one can see the unnatural, eerie glow that seems to perpetually hang over the scarred landscape. This spectral vista casts a pall over Vathirond, a constant reminder of a cataclysm yet to be fully understood. The very sight of it evokes a mix of dread, sorrow, and grim fascination among the city’s inhabitants. Its unnerving presence fuels a sense of urgency among the residents of Vathirond, a constant reminder of the fragility of peace and the cost of conflict. Yet, in a testament to the indomitable spirit of the city’s people, the looming specter of the Mournlands also inspires a defiant determination. They see the Mournlands not just as a symbol of past horrors, but also as a challenge to be overcome, a puzzle to be solved, and a destiny they must prevent for their own city.</p>

<h2 id="the-shattered-crowns">The Shattered Crowns</h2>

<p>Nestled within the city of Vathirond, six semi-autonomous districts – known as the Crowns – stand prominently, each perched atop its own hill and fortified by formidable walls. This unique arrangement provided strategic defense throughout the ravages of The Last War, each Crown bearing the brunt of the conflict and experiencing a different outcome. Each Crown was originally dedicated to a particular artistic discipline, fostering a unique culture and identity that has persisted amidst turmoil. These districts are more than just geographic divisions; they represent the diverse tapestry of Vathirond’s spirit, embodying the resilience, creativity, and individuality of the city’s past and present. The Crowns serve as unique reminders of the city’s artistic heritage, even as they evolve in response to the aftermath of war.</p>

<h3 id="crown-of-masks-applause-and-back-stage-deals">Crown of Masks: Applause and Back Stage Deals</h3>

<p>The stage for stories, the canvas for compelling characters, and the sounding board for stirring soliloquies – the Crown of Masks has been the heart of theater and drama in Vathirond. Despite the ruinous touch of the war, it has retained a faded grandeur. Its buildings are reminiscent of an era of creativity and artistry, their embellished facades narrating tales of yesteryears. This Crown was fortunate to have survived the worst of the Last War, maintaining a semblance of its former glory.</p>

<p>The ward now serves as the militaristic nucleus of Vathirond’s fragmented government. It’s a command hub for military logistics, but also a political stage that hosts heated debates on the city’s future. It is from here that the populist Narani Laseur has polarized the city’s sentiment over refugee resettlement and rebuilding rights.</p>

<p>Laseur’s controversial administration is backed by a private security force, the Firehawk Legion. These goblinoid mercenaries from Darguun are a jarring sight against the backdrop of dramatic mosaics and grand theater facades. However, their presence is a stark reminder of the city’s current reality - a stage where the drama of survival unfolds daily.</p>

<p>The Crown of Masks, once a hub of artistic endeavor, now mirrors the city’s resilience amidst adversity. It’s a poignant testament to the spirit of Vathirond - a city holding onto its identity, its memory of past glory, even as it faces an uncertain future.</p>

<h3 id="crown-of-satyrs-twists-turns-and-triumph">Crown of Satyrs: Twists, Turns, and Triumph</h3>

<p>Among the dance of shadows and the glow of the lantern light, the Crown of Satyrs spins a tale of grace in the face of ruin. The streets here twist and turn like a dancer mid-routine, unraveling onto expansive squares that once pulsated with the rhythm of impromptu performances. This Crown’s spirit proved as nimble as its inhabitants, retaining a significant portion of its population through the throes of The Last War. Community bonds, stronger than the aged stones of their homes, anchor the people in a warm embrace of shared experience and stubborn resilience.</p>

<p>Here, House Phiarlan stands as an enduring symbol of the district’s tenacity, operating from a smaller yet still magnificent corner of their once sprawling complex. Their performers, the city’s mesmerizing heartbeats, still captivate with their tales of sorrow and survival. This Crown, however, does more than dance. It watches. From the city’s underbelly to the swelling tide of refugees, from the ghostly echoes of The Mournlands to the subtle shifts in power within Vathirond, nothing escapes the watchful eyes of the Satyrs.</p>

<h3 id="crown-of-sirens-echoes-of-a-melodious-past">Crown of Sirens: Echoes of a Melodious Past</h3>

<p>The Crown of Sirens, once the jewel of Vathirond’s vibrant music scene, now wears a cloak of desolation. The last notes of harmony faded away during the tumult of the Last War, replaced by the dissonant chords of silence and decay.</p>

<p>In its prime, the Crown of Sirens echoed with melodies that transcended language and culture. It was home to the Lonteu Opera House, a grand stage where performers from across Khorvaire gathered to serenade audiences with their songs. Music was the lifeblood of the ward; it flowed from its concert halls, meandered through its streets, and suffused the air with a symphony of shared emotions - joy, sorrow, love, and longing.  Heavily damaged during the ware, the Opera House is not the headquarters for the Korranberg Institute for Mournlands Research (KIMR).</p>

<p>However, the crescendo of the Last War proved too overwhelming. The Crown’s defenses were breached, and the once-thriving ward bore the brunt of relentless assaults. Its grand architecture was marred by the scars of war, its harmonious rhythm disrupted by the cacophony of destruction.</p>

<p>Today, the Crown of Sirens stands as a testament to the impermanence of glory and the inevitable cycle of creation and ruin. The ward, though a shadow of its former self, has not been completely abandoned. The ruins of once great townhouses serve as a shelter for those displaced by the war. Migrants from Cyre, the Dunvar Valley, and veterans who could not leave the battlefield behind have found solace within its broken walls. Their stories of loss and longing lend a new, melancholic melody to the ward, as poignant as the songs once sung on the opera stage.</p>

<p>House Tharashk, utilizing their unique dragonmarked talents for finding people and things, offer their services to refugees and travelers desperately searching for lost loved ones or belongings in the blighted expanses of the Dunvar Valley and the enigmatic Mournlands. The enclave, while a stark reminder of the tragedies of the past, embodies a spirit of resilience and the enduring hope of reconnection.</p>

        <figcaption class="figure-caption text-center">The Crown of Crafts</figcaption>
    
</figure>

<h3 id="crown-of-crafts-from-artistry-to-industry">Crown of Crafts: From Artistry to Industry</h3>

<p>Once a flourishing hub of creative expression, the Crown of Crafts served as the canvas for Vathirond’s sculptors and painters. Its streets were lined with grand architecture, adorned with vibrant murals and intricate statues that reflected the heart and soul of its citizens. Now, this Crown bears the telltale signs of war’s toll and the relentless march of industry.</p>

<p>The Crown of Crafts, in its heyday, was a living testament to the artistic spirit of Vathirond. Every street corner boasted an artisan’s shop, and the air was suffused with the scent of fresh paint, chiseled stone, and the underlying sense of creation. The once-colorful facades were a riot of artistic expression, every mural telling a story, each statue capturing a moment frozen in time.</p>

<p>However, the Last War brought change - the vibrant strokes of paint and chisel strokes gave way to the clang of metal and the grind of machinery. The Crown, once a sanctuary for artists, was transformed into a massive forge to fuel the war effort and, in its aftermath, the city’s reconstruction.</p>

<p>The Crown of Crafts, once under House Cannith’s influential sway, found new leadership in independent crafters and salvage gangs following the house’s abandonment during the final years of the Last War. House Cannith’s attempts to return and reassert its authority meets strong resistance, as these crafters and gangs who filled the void fiercely defend their hard-earned independence. This struggle has created a cauldron of tension, as the Crown teeters between acknowledging House Cannith’s legacy and embracing their newfound autonomy.</p>

<h3 id="crown-of-sphinxes-watchful-sentries-and-hidden-enigmas">Crown of Sphinxes: Watchful Sentries and Hidden Enigmas</h3>

<p>The Crown of Sphinxes was once a lyrical sanctuary, home to riddlers and poets who spun mysteries into verse and shrouded wisdom in enigma. Its labyrinthine streets held a mystique that whispered of cryptic puzzles and enticing riddles. However, the grandeur of this district was not immune to the ravages of the Last War. In the strategic turmoil, the Moonfox Brigade, soldiers from House Deneith under the command of the Brelish King, claimed this Crown as their military base.</p>

<p>This militarization has stripped the Crown of Sphinxes of some of its old-world charm. The dazzling and enigmatic architecture has been refitted to serve practical, utilitarian purposes, yet echoes of its former glory persist. Faded etchings, inscriptions of old poems, riddles, and sage wisdom, still adorn the worn stone, serving as a poignant reminder of the Crown’s vibrant past.</p>

<p>Access to the Crown of Sphinxes is strictly regulated. Its streets are patrolled day and night by the ever-watchful eyes of the Moonfox Brigade, maintaining a tight rein on security and order. In this austere environment, House Kundarak maintains its presence, a stalwart amidst the change.</p>

<p>While the Crown of Sphinxes has lost some of its whimsical charm, it stands today as a symbol of resilience and adaptation, a testament to Vathirond’s spirit in the face of adversity. Its layered history has left a rich tapestry of tales, a myriad of riddles yet to be solved.</p>

<h3 id="the-crown-of-jests-echos-of-laugher--whispers-of-pain">The Crown of Jests: Echos of Laugher &amp; Whispers of Pain</h3>

<p>The Crown of Jests once rang with peals of laughter and the clamor of revelry, its streets a lively theater of camaraderie and mirth. Where bars, taverns, and burlesque shows were once the heart of Vathirond’s nightlife, an air of strained cheerfulness now prevails. Laughter and music still flow from its many establishments, but they serve more as a balm for the weary souls seeking an escape from the city’s woes than genuine festivity.</p>

<p>Despite the trials of war and its aftermath, the Crown of Jests sees the most traffic among all the Crowns. It offers a welcome respite for residents and visitors alike, a haven where they can briefly forget their troubles amidst the lively taverns, grand townhouses, and street performances.</p>

<p>In this bustling district, House Ghallanda stands as a beacon of hospitality and resilience. Its enclave thrives amidst the revelry and recovery, the house members taking pride in their steadfast support of Vathirond throughout the hardships. The members of House Ghallanda are considered the unofficial caretakers of the Crown of Jests, their establishments serving as a haven for the city’s weary.</p>

<p>House Orien, on the other hand, holds a dwindling presence around the lightning rail line. Once a thriving nexus connecting the far reaches of Khorvaire, the rail line now ends abruptly at the outskirts of Vathirond, cut off by the hauntingly mysterious wall of mist that is the Mournland. Yet even in its decline, the outpost stands as a testament to a more connected era, a time before war and calamity shattered the unity of the continent.</p>

<p>While the Crown of Jests may have lost some of its former vibrancy, its spirit remains undeterred. It serves as a testament to Vathirond’s enduring will to find joy amidst sorrow, to laugh in the face of despair, and to retain a spark of hope amidst the ruins.</p>

<h3 id="the-gutters-resilience-amid-ruin">The Gutters: Resilience Amid Ruin</h3>

<p>Nestled between the walls of Vathirond’s Crowns, away from the majestic hilltops, lie “The Gutters.” This labyrinth of alleyways and improvised dwellings sprawls across the lower depressions of the city, a stark contrast to the high walls and grand structures above.</p>

<p>The Gutters were once home to the laborers and workers whose toil and sweat fueled the life and vibrancy of the Crowns. These hard-working individuals lived and thrived in the shadow of the hilltops, unshielded by the protective walls that enveloped the Crowns. During the Last War, this vulnerability was exploited, and the Gutters bore the brunt of destruction, time and time again. Buildings were razed, families were uprooted, and the streets echoed with the toll of loss.</p>

<p>In the war’s aftermath, however, The Gutters did not stay silent for long. The area quickly became a refuge for the displaced, the downtrodden, and those holding onto the memories of homes lost to the war. Its winding streets and damaged buildings filled up with makeshift homes, erected by refugees and the city’s poorest citizens. Each structure, no matter how frail or makeshift, stands as a monument to human resilience.</p>

<p>Many of the refugees from Cyre found a haven in The Gutters following The Mourning. Struggling with the memory of their fallen kingdom and unable to move on, they have built a life among the ruins, infusing the area with the spirit of their lost homeland. Despite the hardship, or perhaps because of it, a strong sense of community binds the residents of The Gutters. This unity, borne out of shared suffering and hope, has turned The Gutters into a beating heart of survival within Vathirond.</p>

<p>Now, The Gutters are a testament to the human will to endure. Amidst the battered and patched structures, in the narrow alleyways teeming with life, you find stories of courage, resilience, and the undying hope for a better tomorrow. Even in the bleakest of places, the spirit of Vathirond — indomitable and ever enduring — continues to shine.</p>

<h2 id="dunvar-valley-from-fertile-lands-to-haunted-battlegrounds">Dunvar Valley: From Fertile Lands to Haunted Battlegrounds</h2>

<p>The Dunvar Valley, extending hundreds of miles southeast of Vathirond, is a poignant reminder of the cost of war. Once a lush, verdant gem, it was known for its fertile fields and abundant harvests. The valley was a symbol of prosperity, a testament to the bounty of Khorvaire’s heartlands. But the Last War changed everything.</p>

<p>As one of the most hotly contested frontlines, the Dunvar Valley was transformed into a brutal battleground. The soil, once nurturing crops and life, was stained with the blood of soldiers, churned under the weight of war machines, and scarred by the devastating spells of battle mages. The once peaceful landscape was marred by trenches and fortifications, its tranquility shattered by the relentless drumbeat of conflict.</p>

<p>Today, the Dunvar Valley is a treacherous expanse, a haunting vista of war’s devastating aftermath. The skeletal remains of arcane constructs, broken weapons, and discarded munitions litter the land like grim monuments to the lives lost and the peace that was shattered. This battlefield-turned-graveyard is eerily silent, the quiet only broken by the occasional whistle of the wind or the distant cry of a scavenging bird.</p>

<p>Despite its grim nature, the valley has become a source of livelihood for many of Vathirond’s residents. Salvage crews, hardened by their grim work and driven by necessity, comb through the wreckage, risking their lives to recover anything of value. These individuals, often refugees or those unable to find other work, brave the hidden dangers of the valley - unstable magic, booby traps, rogue constructs, and more. Bitter rivalries between salvage crews often spilling over into violent confrontations, echo the conflicts of the past.</p>

<p>The Dunvar Valley serves as a harsh lesson and a bleak memorial to the Last War. Its shattered landscape is a testament to the destructive force of conflict, a warning of the price of ambition and aggression. Yet, amidst the ruins and desolation, the resilience of its people persists. Despite the hardships, they continue to find ways to survive and even hope for a brighter future. In this, the spirit of the Dunvar Valley, much like Vathirond itself, remains unbroken.</p>

<h2 id="faith-in-vathirond-a-beacon-amid-ruin">Faith in Vathirond: A Beacon Amid Ruin</h2>

<p>Religion and faith play a crucial role in the daily lives of Vathirond’s citizens. The city, though shadowed by devastation and strife, remains a place of profound spiritual diversity and resilience. It is in their faith that many find the strength to face the trials of each day, the courage to endure, and the hope to rebuild.</p>

<p>Vathirond boasts numerous temples dedicated to the Sovereign Host, a testament to the enduring popularity of Khorvaire’s principal religion. These grand structures, though weathered by war and time, continue to be places of comfort, guidance, and community. Worship of the Silver Flame, owing to Vathirond’s proximity to Thrane, is also strongly represented. Despite the damage suffered during the Last War, the city’s largest cathedral remains a shining beacon of faith and charity, a source of healing and solace for the weary and the wounded.</p>

<p>In the wake of the refugee influx following the Last War, the city’s spiritual landscape has become even more diverse. Small shrines devoted to lesser deities have sprouted throughout Vathirond, each a testament to the steadfast faith of its followers. The blend of cultures and traditions brought by the refugees has added to the spiritual tapestry of the city, creating a mosaic of faiths living side by side.</p>

<p>Adding to the city’s spiritual depth are the whispered legends of ancient Dhakaani runes and secret shrines to The Dark Six. These rumors speak of hidden places deep beneath the city, mystical relics from a bygone era. While few can confirm the truth of these tales, they continue to fuel the city’s folklore, piquing the interest of adventurers and scholars alike. Some fear the influence of The Dark Six, while others are drawn to the promise of ancient knowledge and power.</p>

<p>Religion in Vathirond is not just a matter of personal belief, but a cornerstone of community identity and solidarity. Amid the ruins of their city, the people of Vathirond cling to their faith, drawing strength from their deities and from one another. Their unbroken spirit, reflected in their enduring religious practices, lights the way towards a hopeful future.</p>

<h2 id="the-shadow-of-house-phiarlan">The Shadow of House Phiarlan</h2>

<p>House Phiarlan’s schism, which gave rise to House Thuranni, was a wound inflicted on the very heart of Vathirond. With the house’s close ties to the arts, Vathirond was a stronghold for Phiarlan, its vibrant culture a camouflage for the house’s covert activities. The schism turned the city into a battlefield overnight, the conflict fought not on open fields but in shadowed corners and behind closed doors.</p>

<p>This silent, deadly night is now referred to as the “Moonlight Murders” among Vathirond’s citizens. It was a ballet of death as spies and assassins moved like wraiths through the city, leaving a trail of bodies in their wake. The next morning, Vathirond woke to an unspoken horror, death having visited its homes, taverns, brothels, and bathhouses alike.</p>

<p>Despite the horrific events of that night, many believe that not all of House Phiarlan’s secrets were laid bare. Whispers of lost dragonmarked artifacts or vaults of stolen knowlege persist, hidden throughout the city, lying in wait to be discovered by the worthy or the fortunate. These artifacts are said to hold immense power, their recovery a matter of pride and prestige within House Phiarlan.</p>

<p>Today, Vathirond is considered a cursed city by House Phiarlan. The scars of the schism run deep, a constant reminder of the house’s internal strife and the lives lost. Despite this, a small outpost remains in the city, its members performing their duties with a bittersweet mix of resolve and resignation. Sent there as a form of punishment, these Phiarlan members continue their work, providing much-needed cheer through their artistic endeavors and keeping an eye on the developments at the edge of the Mournland. The presence of House Phiarlan, albeit nominal, is a testament to Vathirond’s importance and the house’s resilience in the face of adversity.</p>

<h2 id="factions-in-the-fray">Factions in the Fray</h2>

<p>In the wake of the Last War, new powers have risen within Vathirond:</p>

<p><strong>The Moonfox Brigade</strong>, a formidable assembly of House Deneith mercenaries, operates as the bulwark between Vathirond and the ominous threats emanating from The Mournland. Commissioned directly by the Brelish crown, the Brigade’s presence and authority reverberate across the surrounding lands, instilling a sense of guarded stability. Adorned in uniforms bearing their emblem, a fox silhouetted by a silver moon, these disciplined soldiers uphold their duty with unwavering commitment. Yet, beneath the surface of this professional alliance, an undercurrent of tension exists between the Moonfox Brigade, patrolling the rural outskirts, and the Firehawk Legion, who maintain order within the city’s boundaries. This friction not only reflects conflicting methodologies and jurisdictions, but also the broader political complexities that engulf Vathirond.</p>

<p><strong>Narani Laseur</strong>, the enigmatic figurehead of Vathirond, ascended to her position through a veneer of populism that belied her insatiable hunger for power and wealth. Possessing a shrewd ability to capitalize on the city’s dire straits, she turned the tragedies of war into her own profiteering enterprise, harvesting the spoils from the devastated Dunvar Valley and the skeletal remains of The Mournlands. Such voracious exploitation bred deep fissures within the social fabric of Vathirond, exacerbating the divide between the haves and have-nots. Underpinning her reign, the <strong>Firehawk Legion</strong>, a cadre of Darguun Goblinoid mercenaries, serve as the city’s ostensible protectors. Yet, beneath the surface, they are the clawed arm of Laseur’s cabal, bending the rule of law to the will of their matron, enforcing her decrees without question, and ensuring her tainted prosperity thrives amidst the ruins.</p>

<p><strong>The Goonswarm</strong>, Vathirond’s most formidable salvage gang, casts an imposing shadow over the battered expanse of the Dunvar Valley. Their territory spans the sprawling mudfields and makeshift camps that house scores of migrant workers, many refugees from The Mournlands or displaced from the ravages of the Last War. At the helm of this formidable operation is the indomitable Evalin MacTanni, a figure equally feared and respected. Her unyielding ruthlessness and sharp cunning transformed the Goonswarm from a ragtag assembly of scavengers into a well-oiled salvage machine. MacTanni’s charisma has turned the Dunvar Valley into a kingdom of salvage, extracting wealth from the wreckage, remnants, and refuse of battles past. The scars of war have become her treasure trove, promising riches to those desperate enough to risk life and limb amidst the rusted debris and lingering dangers that permeate the region.</p>

<p><strong>The Odd Fellows</strong> exert their influence in the labyrinthine alleys and shadowy corners of Vathirond. This once-disorganized Thieves Guild, composed of neighborhood gangs, banded together in the wake of the city’s devastation during the Last War, forging order from chaos. Under their flag, smuggling routes thrived, clandestine gambling dens buzzed, and a vibrant black market emerged from the ashes. The Odd Fellows have become an intricate part of Vathirond’s post-war fabric, operating as a shadow government within the city, navigating its underworld with unparalleled savvy. However, this rise to power has sparked tension and conflict, particularly with the Goonswarm. These two formidable entities now stand at odds, clashing over the invaluable territory and the highly lucrative market of “salvaged” goods that the ruined city and its surrounding landscapes provide. The Odd Fellows, masters of stealth and subterfuge, are always prepared to play the long game, their moves as unpredictable as the city’s uncertain future.</p>

<p><strong>The Korranberg Institute for Mournlands Research (KIMR)</strong> is a beacon of hope amidst the ruins of Vathirond. Occupying the remains of the once grand Lonteu Opera House in the Crown of Sirens, KIMR is a huddle of academic rigor and unwavering determination. Comprised of intrepid scholars, skilled wizards, and a cadre of brave souls unafraid to probe the enigmatic Mournlands, they have transformed this erstwhile cultural edifice into a nerve center of knowledge and discovery. Amidst the grandeur of fallen arches and dilapidated galleries, they pursue a mission that’s as daunting as it is crucial: to understand the Mournlands, to peel back the layers of mystery shrouding it, and, ultimately, to unearth ways to heal the scars left by the Last War. The scholars of KIMR, though working in the face of unimaginable devastation and under the shadow of the Mournlands, persist, their pursuits lighting the path towards potential restoration and redemption for Vathirond and perhaps all of Khorvaire.</p>

In 5th edition Dungeons &amp; Dragons (D&amp;D), two popular methods of character progression exist: Experience Points (XP) and Milestone Advancement. While Milestone Advancement has its merits, I am here to make a case for XP, an often overlooked, but immensely beneficial system.</p>

<p>In a previous post I discussed the <a href="/2021/02/25/the-zen-of-awarding-experience-for-roleplaying/">Zen of Awarding Experience for Roleplaying</a> which demonstrates an easy method for awarding non-combat experience.  DMs can apply this to exploration or any activity beyond killing creatures. Chapters 8 and 3 of the 5e DMG also provide some guidance on this as well.  I had a recent exchange online that helped me summarize what I see the forgotten benefits of using XP are.  I thought I’d share them here.</p>

<figure class="figure float-end ms-4 clearfix">
    
    <img class="img-fluid figure-img " src="/assets/img/PlayerWithDiceAndPaper.jpg" alt="A player rolling dice and looking over their character sheets." height="480" width="480" />

<p><strong>Building a World One XP at a Time</strong> <br />
XP connects characters to their actions within the world. Each monster slain, each trap disarmed, every cleverly negotiated encounter, earns the characters XP, helping them grow stronger and more skilled. This system offers a tangible reward for engaging with the world, breathing life into the setting and making it matter to the players.</p>

<p>Milestone advancement, on the other hand, rewards characters simply for reaching certain points in the narrative. While this can create a clear path of progression, it misses a fundamental aspect of immersive role-play: the player’s interaction with the world. Milestone Advancement risks reducing the world to a mere backdrop against which the narrative unfolds, rather than an integral part of the story.</p>

<p><strong>Pacing and Enjoying the Adventure with XP</strong>   <br />
An often overlooked benefit of using XP is its influence on the game’s pacing. By linking character progression to actions within the game, XP allows the pace to ebb and flow naturally. It’s not a rigid timer, but a flexible measure of progress that reflects the story’s rhythm and the players’ actions. This fluidity also encourages players to immerse themselves in the unfolding events rather than racing to level up every few sessions.</p>

<p>Moreover, the XP system allows players to savor the charm of lower level play. Personally, I find D&amp;D 5e most enjoyable at levels 7 or below, with a sweet spot between levels 3 to 5. Using XP slows down the game just enough to let players fully experience the content. It provides players, particularly newcomers, with ample time to familiarize themselves with their class abilities, deepening their connection to the game and enhancing their overall experience.</p>

<p><strong>A Diversity of Incentives</strong>   <br />
XP offers a flexible incentive system that can be tailored to the style of your campaign. Too often, DMs limit XP rewards to combat encounters. However, XP can be a motivating factor for a variety of actions. Award XP for clever problem-solving, negotiating with NPCs, or even for great role-playing moments. This diversity of incentives can drive engagement, encouraging players to think creatively and interact with the world in unique ways.</p>

<p><strong>A Log of Memories</strong>  <br />
Tracking XP can also provide an unexpected benefit: a log of your campaign’s major events. By noting down the sources of XP, you create a record of the group’s achievements and memorable moments. This can add depth to your campaign, fostering a sense of nostalgia and achievement as players look back on their journey.</p>

<p><strong>Addressing D&amp;D’s Reward Structure</strong> <br />
However, it’s also crucial to critique the overall reward structure in D&amp;D 5e. Wizards of the Coast, in their bid to make the game more appealing, have filled character classes with numerous abilities. While this empowers players and adds complexity, it also creates a potential issue.</p>

<p>The plethora of class features reduces the need for external rewards such as magical items or gold, thus diminishing the need for characters to interact with the world. This can lead to characters feeling disconnected from the setting or campaign.</p>

<p>Using XP is a small tool to combat this issue. By tying character progression to specific actions and outcomes, XP can reestablish a tangible connection between the characters and the world. It reintroduces the necessity of exploring, negotiating, and engaging with the campaign setting, fostering a more immersive role-playing experience.</p>

<p><strong>A Word of Caution</strong> <br />
While XP offers numerous benefits, it’s essential to be mindful of what you award XP for. Avoid giving XP for actions that undermine the spirit of the game, such as unnecessary aggression or disruptive behavior. XP is a tool to guide your players, encouraging them to engage in ways that enrich the campaign. Also, don’t fall into the trap of awarding XP to correct <strong>bad</strong> behavior at the table.  Many DMs who use XP look at negative player behavior and think and easy solution is to award experience for things like collaborating or showing up on time.  This seems attractive, but using in game incentives to address out of game issues will always come back to bite you. If there is behavior that needs to be address, do that, but don’t fall into the trap of thinking in game rules will correct bad player behavior.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>  <br />
In conclusion, XP is more than just a mechanic for character progression. It’s a tool that, when used correctly, can foster engagement, enhance immersion, and create a richer, more rewarding D&amp;D experience. In 5th edition, our tools for connecting players to the world are few. Finding fun ways to do that can help build a more holistic narrative and immersive experience for all.  What do you think though?  How has experience worked for you in the past? Would you be tempted to give XP a try after reading this or are you ride-or-die on Milestone?

As a devoted Tabletop Roleplaying Game enthusiast, I’d like to delve into this intriguing query and shed some light on the cultural and historical influences that shaped these iconic facets of the game.</p>

<figure class="figure float-end ms-4 clearfix">

<p>As an side, if you haven’t had a chance to check out <a href="https://dmdavid.com/" target="_blank">DMDavid’s Blog</a>, I highly recommend it.</p>

<p><strong>Understanding the Historical Context</strong>
To truly appreciate the distinction between the Astral and Ethereal planes in DnD, we need to consider the historical context. The inception of DnD occurred during a transformative period in the United States, post the counter-culture revolution, which significantly influenced the game’s development.</p>

<p>This counter-culture era witnessed a surge in a form of pseudo-spiritualism, centered around mind enlightenment and contacting higher planes, starkly contrasting previous generations’ spiritual practices, which were more focused on spirit communication and ancient powers.</p>

<p><strong>The Ethereal and Astral Planes: Inspired by Cultural Icons</strong>
In the minds of the DnD creators, the Ethereal plane became a domain of ghosts and the dead, drawing inspiration from pop culture figures like Aleister Crowley and skeptics like Harry Houdini. Conversely, the Astral Plane symbolized the realm of the mind, influenced by counter-culture figures like Aldous Huxley and Timothy Leary, or popular culture authors like Carlos Castaneda.</p>

<p>As DMDavid rightly noted, the depiction of these planes in DnD also heavily reflects the nerd pop-culture of that time, including elements from comic book characters like Doctor Strange or from movies like the Hammer Horror Films. However, rather than tracing back to a single source, it’s more accurate to understand these planes as a reflection of the era’s prevailing thoughts and influences.</p>

<p><strong>The Game Design Perspective</strong>
From a game design viewpoint, the Ethereal and Astral planes provided a neat division between the realm of ghosts and the realm of psionics. This division addressed two main issues. First, it offered thematic consistency, neatly categorizing monsters and adventure themes. Second, it helped differentiate the rules for magic and ghosts from those for psionics, which were distinct in early D&amp;D.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the original Dungeon Master’s Guide had a staggering 24 planes, slicing not just along alignment lines but also across various narrative tones, such as emotion, thought, spirituality, and more.</p>

<p><strong>The Modern Perspective</strong>
Fast forward to modern D&amp;D, the distinction between the Astral and Ethereal planes seems to have lost much of its significance. The 5th edition (5e) appears to lean towards streamlining gameplay, favoring reduced complexity over the detailed cosmological intricacies of early D&amp;D. For instance, Asmodeus has been elevated as the face of all devils, and the Nine Hells is now the most often cited plane.</p>

<p>While 5e continues to reference other planes, its focus is more on simplifying references for seamless play. This approach contrasts with the early days of D&amp;D, where the cosmology’s complexity was part of the allure, sparking a sense of the unknown in its audience.</p>

<p>In the end, each player must decide whether this shift towards simplification is beneficial. Regardless of the answer, the origins and historical context of the Astral and Ethereal planes in DnD provide a fascinating glimpse into the game’s rich and diverse influences, adding another layer of depth to this already immersive game.</p>]]></content><author><name>Scott Turnbull</name></author><category term="RPG Resources" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A history of the origins of the astral and ethereal plans in DnD and why they exist.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://www.optionalrule.com/assets/img/transativeplanes.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://www.optionalrule.com/assets/img/transativeplanes.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Design Goals of Etherea</title><link href="https://www.optionalrule.com/2023/05/14/design-goals-of-etherea/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Design Goals of Etherea" /><published>2023-05-14T11:10:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-05-14T11:10:00+00:00</updated><id>https://www.optionalrule.com/2023/05/14/design-goals-of-etherea</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.optionalrule.com/2023/05/14/design-goals-of-etherea/"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday, I posted some initial lore for <a href="/2023/05/13/the-world-of-etherea/">Etherea</a> (Ah-Ther-ee-ah), a homebrew world am interested in developing for a setting I’m creating for a new <a href="https://www.thearcanelibrary.com/pages/shadowdark" target="_blank">Shadowdark</a> game. This is a personal endeavor, not intended for publication (other than on my blog here). I’m captivated by the idea of things manifesting in the world based on emotions, beliefs, etc., and the resulting chaos of magic surrounding it. The concept is akin to the Umbra from Werewolf: The Forsaken, Spren in the Stormlight Archives, or entities like the creature in the Babadook that manifests from fear or unfulfilled wishes.</p>

<p>An essential aspect of Etherea is its vibrant diversity. The gods are not a static, singular pantheon, but a fluid and dynamic reflection of the world’s diverse cultures, beliefs, and aspirations. The world doesn’t merely exist; it actively shapes itself in response to the collective imaginations, desires, and fears of its inhabitants. This mutable nature is a double-edged sword. It’s both the root of Etherea’s challenges and the source of its profound beauty and richness.</p>

<p>As a game setting, I’m interested in creating lore elements that:</p>

<figure class="figure float-end ms-4 clearfix">
    
    <img class="img-fluid figure-img " src="/assets/img/design-of-etherea.jpg" alt="A man sitting at a desk writing while surrounded by fantasy imagines from their imagination." height="480" width="480" />
    
    
</figure>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Provide rich backstories and conflicts for characters:</strong> The history and cultures of Etherea, the tensions between Weavers and the devout, and the looming threats of the Umbraweave all provide interesting hooks for character backstories and personal quests.</li>
  <li><strong>Facilitate immersive world-building:</strong> The interplay between Etherea and the Umbraweave, the mystery of fallen civilizations, and the omnipresent influence of the gods create a rich tapestry for players to explore and interact with.</li>
  <li><strong>Drive interesting adventures and quests:</strong> The dangers lurking in the shadows of the Umbraweave, the treasures hidden in the ruins of once-great empires, and the complex religious and magical dynamics of Etherea provide a myriad of opportunities for thrilling adventures.</li>
  <li><strong>Encourage exploration of thematic elements:</strong> The nuances of harnessing emotions to shape magic, the ethical implications of manipulating the Umbraweave, and the balance between faith and personal power all offer players the chance to delve into deeper thematic discussions.</li>
  <li><strong>Promote varied gameplay styles:</strong> The setting supports a wide range of gameplay styles, from combat-focused adventures battling Echoforms, to diplomatic missions negotiating religious tensions, to exploration and puzzle-solving in the remnants of fallen civilizations.</li>
  <li><strong>Foster dynamic NPC interactions:</strong> The diverse cultures, religious beliefs, and attitudes towards magic in Etherea provide a rich cast of potential NPCs for players to interact with, each with their own unique perspectives and motivations.</li>
</ol>

<p>As a tool for driving adventures, I want Etherea to offer a wealth of in-game elements, directly woven into its lore. This should provide a cohesive narrative framework for diverse adventures:</p>

<figure class="figure float-end ms-4 clearfix">
    
    <img class="img-fluid figure-img " src="/assets/img/etherea-crystal-rain-ruin.jpg" alt="A massive ruin in an overgrown forest glows from the inside while crystal rain falls from the sky." height="480" width="480" />
    
    
</figure>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Monster Encounters with Deep Lore:</strong> Monsters in Etherea aren’t just random encounters. Each creature is a manifestation of the region’s history, emotions, and events, channeled through the Umbraweave. An abandoned ruin that fell victim to a cataclysmic event isn’t simply vacant; it teems with vile creatures such as goblins, ghasts, and gibbering mouthers, all born from the tragedy’s echo within the Umbraweave.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Enhanced Magic System:</strong> The Umbraweave’s influence over magic allows for an amplification of the spell failure system already present in Shadowdark. Misshapen spells can take on a life of their own, turning against their caster, and creating both challenging and thrilling magic usage scenarios.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Adventure Hooks Rooted in World-Building:</strong> The world encourages various adventuring themes. Echohunters serve as a <em>Witcher-esque</em> professional class, hunting down dangerous Umbraweave manifestations. Delvers seek the mysteries and riches hidden within the ruins of the old world. Additionally, as Etherea rebuilds itself, emerging powers vie for dominance, creating a rich tapestry of political intrigue. The setting intentionally distances itself from the static “<em>Disneyland adventure</em>” style, focusing instead on a dynamic, ever-evolving world.</p>
  </li>

<p>The core lore of Etherea—its cataclysmic history, the mystical Umbraweave, and complex religious dynamics—lays the groundwork for expanding on these elements. This initial exploration is primarily focused on establishing the foundation for the setting. In the coming weeks, I aim to delve deeper into the practical applications of these elements within the game. I’ll further explore how they can be leveraged to craft engaging and immersive adventures in the world of Etherea.</p>

<p>Following this, I’ll take a stab at creating a few actual towns. I plan to use spiral world development for this task, building out from some core settlements.</p>]]></content><author><name>Scott Turnbull</name></author><category term="Shadowdark" /><category term="Lore" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[An introduction my homebrew setting of Etherea, for use with the Shadowdark RPG.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://www.optionalrule.com/assets/img/design-of-etherea.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://www.optionalrule.com/assets/img/design-of-etherea.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Introduction to the World of Etherea</title><link href="https://www.optionalrule.com/2023/05/13/the-world-of-etherea/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Introduction to the World of Etherea" /><published>2023-05-13T15:46:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-05-13T15:46:00+00:00</updated><id>https://www.optionalrule.com/2023/05/13/the-world-of-etherea</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.optionalrule.com/2023/05/13/the-world-of-etherea/"><![CDATA[<p>Etherea is the initial idea for a setting I’ve crafted for the <a href="https://www.thearcanelibrary.com/pages/shadowdark" target="_blank">Shadowdark</a> Tabletop Roleplaying game, designed to foster a sense of intrigue and danger inherent in the exploration of magic and the supernatural. The core concept of the world, the Umbraweave, is meant to evoke a persistent sense of mystery and unease, underlining the idea that behind the veil of reality, potent emotions and intense events birth spirits that drift in the shadows. The aim is to instill a constant sense of tension and wonder in the players, offering them a world where magic is as unpredictable and dangerous as it is powerful.</p>

<p>These initial freeform thoughts on Etherea’s history, the rationale behind its magic, and the intricate weave of its religious beliefs are intended to set the stage for an array of adventurous narratives. The remnants of once great empires and fallen civilizations provide a treasure trove of mysteries to unearth, ancient secrets to decipher, and lost treasures to claim. The omnipresent threat of the Umbraweave and its Echoforms, alongside the complex interplay between Weavers and the pious, further drive the sense of imminent danger and conflict. Overall, Etherea is a world shaped by its past, teeming with potential for daring exploits, and ripe for heroes to make their mark.</p>

<p>I plan to continue to chip away at this setting as I gear up to run some Shadowdark in the near future.</p>

<p>Etherea is a shattered world that was once teeming with magic and wonder. Its landscape was adorned with grand citadels, crystal forests, and cities of floating spires that touched the stars. Etherea was home to mighty empires and enlightened civilizations whose command of magic was unrivaled. They had learned to dance with the Umbraweave, the mysterious realm of spirits, making it their partner in the grand performance of existence.</p>

<p>In the age known as the Aetherium, the Weavers of Legend, Etherea’s most powerful mages, sought to harness the Umbraweave’s power in unprecedented ways. In their ambition, they dared to pull the Umbraweave closer to Etherea, believing they could tame the wild energies of the spectral realm and bend them to their will.</p>

<p>However, their hubris proved to be their downfall. This cataclysmic event, now known as the Echofall, triggered an uncontrolled flood of magic and spirits into Etherea. The once distant whisper of the Umbraweave became a deafening roar. Echoforms, both benevolent and malevolent, poured into the world, their unchecked power reshaping reality and wreaking havoc on the once-great civilizations.</p>

<p>Kingdoms fell overnight, their grand cities crumbling under the onslaught of wild magic. Forests grew and withered in the span of moments, and rivers flowed backwards, their waters turning into shimmering liquid light. Beings of pure emotion roamed the land, their mere presence inciting joy, despair, rage, and a thousand other emotions in those they encountered. The world was thrown into chaos, and the great cultures of Etherea were reduced to ruins and distant memories.</p>

<p>For centuries, Etherea was a fractured realm, a shadow of its former glory. Yet, life is resilient, and the spark of civilization is not easily extinguished. Humanity, along with the other races of Etherea, slowly began to adapt to this new reality, learning to live among the Echoforms and the unpredictable forces of magic. New settlements began to sprout amidst the ruins of the old, like flowers blooming amidst the rubble.</p>

<p>Now, hundreds of years after the Echofall, civilization is once again taking root in Etherea. The world is still wild and dangerous, but the people of Etherea have learned much from their tragic past. The Weavers have rekindled their ancient traditions, guiding their people in the delicate dance with the Umbraweave.</p>

<p>The echoes of the past still resonate in the Umbraweave, but Etherea stands poised at the dawn of a new age. It is a time of hope and fear, a time of magic and monsters, a time of heroes and legends yet to be born. The story of Etherea continues, written by those brave enough to shape their destiny in a world where thoughts and emotions can reshape reality.</p>

<h2 id="the-lore-of-the-shadow-spirits">The Lore of the Shadow Spirits</h2>

<p>In the realm of Etherea, a world teetering on the precipice of light and darkness, the thoughts, emotions, and actions of every living being are far more potent than they appear. Unseen by mortal eyes, a shadowy realm lies adjacent to our own, a spectral echo of Etherea known as the Umbraweave. Here, spirits manifest and drift, formed and fueled by the potent emotions and events that transpire in the world of the living.</p>

<p>The Umbraweave is not just a reflection but an amplifier of our world. An argument between lovers might birth a minor spirit of discord, while a great battle may give rise to a terrifying spirit of destruction. These spirits, known as Echoforms, exist in a vast array, each embodying a different facet of mortal experience. From fleeting spirits of joy, born from laughter and merriment, to lingering spirits of sorrow, born from loss and grief, each Echoform is a testament to the emotional tapestry of Etherea.</p>

<p>The people of Etherea have developed intricate beliefs and rituals over centuries to contend with the influence of the Umbraweave. The threat of inadvertently creating or attracting malevolent Echoforms has shaped a society that values emotional balance and mindful action. Celebrations are tempered with moments of quiet reflection, and even in war, soldiers take moments to calm their anger and focus their intent, lest they birth spirits of uncontrolled wrath.</p>

<p>Warding off these spirits has become an essential part of life. People carry talismans imbued with positive emotions to shield against spirits of anger or sorrow. Homes are often adorned with intricate glyphs, prayers, and blessings to keep the dwelling safe from Echoforms. Mirrors, believed to be gateways to the Umbraweave, are covered at night to prevent spirits from crossing over into the physical world.</p>

<p>Despite the fear of the Umbraweave, not all spirits are seen as harmful. Some Echoforms are considered beneficial, such as spirits of inspiration born from creativity, or spirits of love born from deep affection. These spirits are often invited into homes and gatherings with specific rituals, offerings, and music.</p>

<p>It is the task of the Spiritseers, individuals gifted with the ability to perceive the Umbraweave and communicate with Echoforms, to navigate the delicate balance of this world. They work to placate harmful spirits, invite beneficial ones, and guide society in their complex dance with the Echoforms.</p>

<p>The Umbraweave’s existence has shaped the world of Etherea in profound ways. It is a testament to the power of emotion, a stark reminder of the consequences of actions, and a hauntingly beautiful mirror to the world of the living. In Etherea, one’s inner state is not just a personal affair; it can shape the world and echo through the shadowy reaches of the Umbraweave.</p>

<h3 id="arcana-of-the-umbraweave">Arcana of the Umbraweave</h3>

<p>Magic in Etherea is not merely a tool, but a profound expression of the inner self interacting with the vast, unseen forces of the Umbraweave. It is an art of intention and emotion, a delicate dance with the Echoforms, and a testament to the willpower of those who dare to shape reality through the shadow realm.</p>

<p>The practitioners of this art are known as Weavers. By fostering intense emotions, vivid thoughts, and unwavering intent within themselves, Weavers can resonate with the forces of the Umbraweave and give form to magic. These spells can range from minor enchantments, like kindling a spark of flame or whispering to the wind, to cataclysmic events, such as commanding a storm or shaking the very earth.</p>

<p>Weaving is a delicate process, requiring not just raw emotion but also precise control. A Weaver must learn to balance the intensity of their feelings with the clarity of their intentions. Too much emotion without control can result in a Wild Surge, an unpredictable burst of magic that resonates with the caster’s uncontrolled feelings. This often results in a rogue Echoform being birthed into the world, a force with desires and goals of its own, unbound and potentially harmful to the Weaver and those around them.</p>

<p>A Weaver’s path is one of constant self-discovery and discipline. They must learn to explore their inner emotional landscapes, confront their fears, and channel their passions. They must also learn to understand the Echoforms, for each spell is a conversation, a negotiation with the spirits of the Umbraweave.</p>

<p>There are many ways to become a Weaver. Some are born with an innate connection to the Umbraweave, while others study under experienced mentors. Some find their calling through near-death experiences, profound emotional events, or deep spiritual revelations.</p>

<p>The Echo Codex, a sacred text among Weavers, details the known Echoforms and the emotions that give them form. It also outlines the techniques to master one’s emotional state and provides guidance on negotiating with Echoforms. The Codex is not just a book but a living record, continually updated with the discoveries and experiences of Weavers across Etherea.</p>

<p>In Etherea, magic is not just an exercise of power; it’s a testament to one’s inner strength, a reflection of their deepest emotions, and a constant reminder of the delicate balance between control and chaos.</p>

<h3 id="divinity-and-faith-in-etherea">Divinity and Faith in Etherea</h3>

<p>In the world of Etherea, the divine is not a distant concept but an integral part of life, woven into the fabric of existence itself. Above the Echo-laden Umbraweave, in realms of spiritual vision and celestial majesty, dwell the gods of Etherea.</p>

<p>Each god embodies a grand ideal, a celestial echo of the aspirations, hopes, and fears of the mortal world. They range from Luminara, the goddess of Light and Hope, to Obsidia, the god of Shadows and Secrets. Their influences are as varied as the ideals they embody, their will projected into the world through the spiritual conduit of the Umbraweave.</p>

<p>The people of Etherea honor these gods in their daily lives. Grand temples and humble shrines dot the landscapes, each a testament to the devotion of the faithful. Most Ethereans practice a form of polytheism, offering prayers and sacrifices to multiple gods depending on their needs, desires, or fears. However, some individuals feel a deep connection to a single god and dedicate their lives to that deity’s service. This devotion might stem from a desire for protection, a quest for personal power, or a profound spiritual calling.</p>

<p>This deep faith has led to a tension between the devout and the Weavers. Many of the pious see Weavers as attempting to usurp the divine, their manipulation of the Umbraweave seen as an audacious challenge to the gods themselves. This tension sometimes leads to conflict, with Weavers facing persecution or mistrust in more devout communities.</p>

<p>Yet the divine landscape of Etherea is not limited to these grand ideals. Just as the world is filled with Echoforms, so too is it filled with smaller gods, local deities born from intense Echoforms fostered by specific traditions, rites, or even locations. These deities might rule over a single river, a particular forest, or even a humble village. They are deeply tied to the communities that worship them, their fates and fortunes often seen as intertwined.</p>

<p>Such is the grand tapestry of faith in Etherea. It is a world where the divine is as varied and complex as the people who worship them, where the line between mortal and god can blur, and where the echoes of belief shape not just the Umbraweave, but the very fate of the world itself.</p>]]></content><author><name>Scott Turnbull</name></author><category term="Shadowdark" /><category term="Lore" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[An introduction my homebrew setting of Etherea, for use with the Shadowdark RPG.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://www.optionalrule.com/assets/img/etherea-setting-lineart.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://www.optionalrule.com/assets/img/etherea-setting-lineart.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Revised Injured Condition</title><link href="https://www.optionalrule.com/2023/05/13/revised-injury-condition/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Revised Injured Condition" /><published>2023-05-13T10:30:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-05-13T10:30:00+00:00</updated><id>https://www.optionalrule.com/2023/05/13/revised-injury-condition</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.optionalrule.com/2023/05/13/revised-injury-condition/"><![CDATA[<p>Introducing a lasting injury system in Dungeons and Dragons 5th edition can greatly enhance the depth and realism of your adventures.

This system not only makes every decision in battle consequential but also turns health into a crucial resource that demands thoughtful management, adding a layer of strategic complexity.</p>

<p>The lasting injury mechanic fosters a sense of camaraderie among players as they must now invest in each other’s well-being, reinforcing the bonds of their adventuring party. By raising the stakes in this way, victories become even more rewarding, and surviving against the odds offers an unparalleled sense of accomplishment. In essence, this system deepens player engagement, making every encounter, decision, and dice roll truly matter in their shared story.</p>

<p>Below is a revised version of the <a href="/2022/10/01/injured-condition-onednd/">original Injury Rules</a> I created based on the OneDnD playtest changes to Exhaustion.</p>

<h3 id="injured-condition">Injured [Condition]</h3>

<p>While you are subject to the Injured Condition, you experience the following effects:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Levels of Injury.</strong> This Condition is cumulative. Each time you receive it, you gain 1 level of injury. You die if your injury level exceeds 10.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>d20 Rolls Affected.</strong> When you make a d20 Test, you subtract your injury level from your d20 roll.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Spell Save DCs Affected.</strong> Subtract your injury level from the Spell save DC of any Spell you cast.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Gaining the Condition.</strong> A character gains 1 level of Injury whenever they fail a death save or if they are damaged by more than half their max hit points from a single source of damage. Characters killed through the Massive Damage rules gain 10 levels of Injury.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Recovering.</strong> Immediately after finishing a Long Rest, the character may make a DC 10 Constitution Test, removing 1 level of injury on a success. Characters who fail by rolling a 1 gain an additional injury level. A character may gain advantage on a recovery roll if they are being provided medical care, provided hot meals, and in a restful environment, or other conditions as determined by the DM. Characters without adequate shelter or in a very stressful environment roll recovery at disadvantage. When their injury level reaches 0, the character is no longer injured.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="class-ability">Class Ability</h4>

<p><strong>Shake it Off.</strong> Fighters, Paladins, and Rangers gain the ‘Shake it off’ ability at 1st level. As a free action, the character can choose to tap their deep reserves of fortitude to prevent taking one level of Injury. They can use this ability once and regain the ability to do so after a Long Rest.</p>

<h4 id="magic">Magic</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Healing Injury with Magic.</strong> One level of Injury may be removed by casting Lesser Restoration. Greater Restoration removes all levels of injury.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Bring Out Your Dead.</strong> Any injury remains with a character brought back to life through Revivify, or Raise Dead, with a maximum of Injury level 9. Resurrection, True Resurrection, and Wish bring characters back to life with 0 levels of injury.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>In conclusion, incorporating the Injury rules in a Dungeons and Dragons game adds a whole new layer of strategic depth and emotional engagement. It elevates the stakes of every combat encounter, pushing players to think more critically about their actions and encouraging a greater sense of camaraderie within the party. This not only enhances the realism of the game but also enriches the storytelling, creating a more immersive and memorable experience. While it’s a more challenging way to play, the rewards are substantial, making each victory a testament to the players’ resilience and teamwork.</p>]]></content><author><name>Scott Turnbull</name></author><category term="RPG Resources" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A simple and quick lasting injuries system for DnD based on the Exhausted playtest.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://www.optionalrule.com/assets/img/treating-injuries480x480.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://www.optionalrule.com/assets/img/treating-injuries480x480.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry></feed>
