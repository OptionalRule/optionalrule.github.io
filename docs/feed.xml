The familiar scent of fresh ink and new possibilities filling the air, you might notice something different. The default setting isn’t the Forgotten Realms in the latest edition. Instead, you’re reading about a world called Greyhawk. For some of you, this name might spark a nostalgic gleam in your eye. For others, it might be a curious first encounter. So what is with the new default setting for DnD 2024? Lets take a journey to the <a href="https://greyhawkonline.com/" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk</a>, D&amp;D’s original campaign setting, and find out what we’re in for.</p>

<h3 id="greyhawk-the-og-of-dd-worlds">Greyhawk: The OG of D&amp;D Worlds</h3>

<p>First things first - what exactly is Greyhawk? Well, imagine if Gary Gygax, one of the founding fathers of D&amp;D, decided to create an entire world. Oh wait, he did! That’s Greyhawk in a nutshell. This high fantasy setting centers on the continent of Oerth (yes, that’s Earth with an ‘O’, because why not?), with most of the action taking place in a region called the Flanaess.</p>

<p>Now, I know what some of you are thinking. “But I’ve been playing in the Forgotten Realms for years! Why the change?” Well, my friends, sometimes to move forward, we need to take a step back. And in this case, we’re stepping back to the very roots of D&amp;D.</p>

<h3 id="a-brief-history-of-greyhawk">A Brief History of Greyhawk</h3>

<p>Before we dive deeper into what makes Greyhawk tick, let’s take a quick jaunt through its history. Trust me, it’ll help you appreciate just how momentous this return really is.</p>

<p>Greyhawk’s journey began in the early 1970s as Gary Gygax’s personal campaign setting. But it didn’t say his for long - it quickly became a collaborative effort, with many of D&amp;D’s original creators leaving their mark on this burgeoning world.</p>

<p>Take, for instance, David Arneson’s Castle Blackmoor. This mega-dungeon, one of the earliest and most iconic in D&amp;D history, found its home in the north of Greyhawk. Its influence? Monumental. From the sprawling levels of Undermountain in the Forgotten Realms to the demon-infested halls of video games like Diablo, Blackmoor’s DNA is everywhere.</p>

<p>Many of D&amp;D’s most iconic NPCs - names like Bigby and Robilar - started as characters in Gary’s original play group. It was a world built not just by designers, but by players, their adventures weaving the very fabric of the setting. This to me always solidified the idea that collaborative world-building was fundamental to the D&amp;D experience. Shared setting development was part of the bones of the game from the start.</p>

<p>It wasn’t until 1980 that fans like myself got our first real taste of this rich world with the release of the <a href="https://archive.org/details/tsr09025worldofgreyhawkfolio" target="_blank">World of Greyhawk folio</a>. For a pre-teen me, it was like discovering that all those disconnected adventures actually existed in a fully-realized world. I gave me that feeling of a deep, living world that captivated me in the fictional settings I loved so much.</p>

<p>The 1983 “Gold Box” set expanded the world even further. Throughout the 80s and early 90s, Greyhawk thrived, with countless adventures, sourcebooks, and articles fleshing out its rich tapestry of cultures and conflicts.</p>

<p>The late 90s and early 2000s saw Greyhawk take a bit of a backseat, but it never truly went away. The “Living Greyhawk” organized play campaign kept the flame alive, allowing players to continue shaping the world’s ongoing narrative. If I recall correctly, this was the origin of what would eventually become the DnD Adventurers League we know today.</p>

<p>And now, after years of teasing references in various 5e products, Greyhawk is poised to reclaim its place at the heart of D&amp;D with the upcoming 2024 edition. It’s a homecoming decades in the making, and for many of us old-timers, it feels like reuniting with an old friend - a friend who’s been shaped by countless hands and imaginations over the years.</p>

<h3 id="a-tapestry-of-cultures-and-conflict">A Tapestry of Cultures and Conflict</h3>

<p>The core region of Greyhawk was the region of Flanaess. Originally steeped in a strong Eurasian flavor (a product of its time), Greyhawk has since evolved, expanding its cultural horizons beyond its initial borders. Yet, it still carries the DNA of the literary giants that inspired the very foundations of D&amp;D. You can feel the gritty urban landscapes of Fritz Leiber’s Lankhmar, the moral ambiguity of Michael Moorcock’s Eternal Champion saga, the primal energy of Robert E. Howard’s Hyborian Age, and the dying earth vibes of Jack Vance’s work.</p>

<p>At the heart of human civilization are the Oeridians, who once ran the show with their Great Kingdom of Aerdy. Imagine walking the haunted streets of Rauxes, the former capital, now a chilling reminder of how far the mighty can fall. Or picture yourself in the courts of Furyondy, where noble knights plan their next move against the evil forces of Iuz to the north.</p>

<p>But the Oeridians aren’t the only players in this game. To the west, you’ve got the Baklunish cultures in states like Ekbir and Zeif. Think minarets piercing the sky, bazaars bustling with strange wares, and magical traditions that would make your average Oeridian wizard’s pointy hat spin.</p>

<p>And let’s not forget the Suel. These folks have a bit of a checkered past, what with the Scarlet Brotherhood lurking in the shadows. Imagine a secret society of working in the shadows to infiltrate ever aspect of society, with plans spanning the continent. Paranoid yet? You should be.</p>

<p>Then there are the Flan, the original humans of these lands. Their great civilizations might have faded, but their legacy lives on in places like Tenh and among the nomadic Rovers of the Barrens. These are the folks who can tell you what the Flanaess was like before it was cool.</p>

<h3 id="welcome-to-the-city-of-adventure">Welcome to the City of Adventure</h3>

<p>At the heart of all this stands the Free City of Greyhawk itself. A melting pot of cultures where an Oeridian merchant might be haggling with a Baklunish mage over a Flan artifact, all while a Suel thief picks both their pockets. It’s a city of adventure, intrigue, and more shady deals than you can shake a wand of fireballs at. At the time, it was obvious to me that the City of Greyhawk was the city of Lankhmar from Fritz Leiber’s Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser stories, so I was immediatly hooked.</p>

<p>But humans aren’t the only ones stirring the pot. The Ulek States show us that dwarves, elves, and gnomes have long established cutures of their own. They’re right in the thick of it, forging alliances and shaping the political landscape alongside their human neighbors. This carried much of the tension between cultures that setup a dangerous world in the original days of DnD, which I think ahs softened over time. It will be interesting to see what tension DMs setup in their own versions of Greyhawk.</p>

<h3 id="why-greyhawk-why-now">Why Greyhawk? Why Now?</h3>

<p>So, why is Wizards of the Coast bringing Greyhawk back into the spotlight? Well, for one, it’s a return to roots for the 50th anniversary of D&amp;D. Greyhawk is where many of D&amp;D’s iconic elements were born. Ever cast Mordenkainen’s Magnificent Mansion or Bigby’s Hand? You can thank Greyhawk for those. Ever delved into the Tomb of Horrors or faced the horrors of the Temple of Elemental Evil? Greyhawk, baby.</p>

<p>But it’s more than just nostalgia. Greyhawk offers a grittier, more grounded take on high fantasy than the Forgotten Realms. It’s a world where political intrigue is as deadly as any dragon’s breath, where the line between hero and villain is often blurred, and where every victory feels hard-earned. For me, it’s the template for one of my favorite 2e settings, Birthright. At least, this is the original vision of Greyhawk.  I think it’s fair to say that WotC has a more portable vision in mind, a Greyhawk that can adapt to any group, any world, and any story. I have to confess, if this is the case, it makes me a little sad.  A setting should have a point of view, a flavor that makes it unique.  I adore the Forgotten Realms, and I love the homebrew that has sprung from it, but Greyhawk deserves more than a simple “generic fantasy” approach.</p>

<p>WotC has been teasing us with Greyhawk references throughout the 5e era. But now, with part of the recent Vecna: Eve of Ruin module set on Oerth, it seems they’re finally ready to pull back the curtain.  I sincerly hope they do it justice when the setting returns to the 2024 Dungeon Master’s Guide in November.</p>

<h3 id="what-this-means-for-you">What This Means for You</h3>

<p>Whether you’re a grizzled veteran eager to return to familiar lands or a wide-eyed newcomer ready to explore this classic setting for the first time, Greyhawk’s return as the default D&amp;D setting is big news. But what does it really mean for your gaming table?</p>

<p>First off, if you’re hoping to recreate the gritty feel of original Greyhawk, you might find yourself wrestling with the D&amp;D 2024 system. Let’s face it, D&amp;D hasn’t been truly gritty for a long time, and the 2024 edition seems to be dialing up the power level yet another notch. This presents an interesting challenge for DMs: how do you maintain Greyhawk’s classic tone when your players are wielding more power than ever?</p>

<p>On the flip side, the new Bastion system introduced in the 2024 DMG could be a perfect fit for Greyhawk’s political landscape. Players might find themselves quickly rising to become lords of their own realms. Having a rich, detailed setting like Greyhawk to ground these newfound fiefdoms could be incredibly satisfying - provided your players buy into the world’s deep background and complex politics.</p>

<p>It’ll be fascinating to see WotC’s modern take on this classic setting. How will they balance nostalgia with the need to appeal to new players? How dedicated will they be to fully supporting Greyhawk beyond its initial reintroduction? And perhaps most intriguingly, how will the new Greyhawk interact with the evolving Open Gaming License (OGL)? These are questions that could shape not just how we play in Greyhawk, but how we engage with D&amp;D as a whole in the coming years.</p>

<p>For DMs, this means a wealth of opportunities. You’ll have access to a rich, detailed world with decades of lore to draw from. At the same time, you’ll face the challenge of adapting this classic setting to modern game mechanics and player expectations. It’s a chance to blend the best of old-school D&amp;D with the innovations of recent years.</p>

<p>For players, Greyhawk offers a world ripe for exploration and conquest. Whether you’re delving into the depths of Castle Greyhawk, navigating the political intrigues of the Free City, or carving out your own baronies with the Bastion system, there’s no shortage of adventures waiting for you.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the return of Greyhawk is more than just a nostalgic throwback. It’s an opportunity to bridge the gap between D&amp;D’s roots and its future, to explore how a classic setting can evolve to meet the needs of modern players while still retaining its unique charm. Whether this experiment succeeds will depend not just on WotC’s execution, but on how we as a community embrace and shape this new incarnation of a beloved world.</p>

<p>So, are you ready to make your mark on the Flanaess? To walk the streets of the Free City, to face the horrors lurking in Castle Greyhawk, to shape the fate of empires? Greyhawk is calling, adventurers. And this time, it’s calling from the very core of D&amp;D itself. The question is: how will you answer?</p>]]></content><author><name>Scott Turnbull</name></author><category term="rpg resources" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Explore Greyhawk's return as D&D's default setting in 2024.

The mere mention of artificial intelligence in our beloved hobby often sparks heated debates and anxiety. There’s a palpable fear that AI might replace the human creativity that forms the very essence of tabletop roleplaying games. In these discussions, we’ve sometimes been too quick to judge, too harsh in our criticisms, and perhaps a bit too reactionary. Without doubt, there’s Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD) surrounding AI, but there are also great possibilities when used thoughtfully. As with many topics in our community, we need to approach the AI conversation with more open-mindedness and less cruelty towards those with differing views. After all, the spirit of TTRPGs is one of collaboration and imagination – qualities we should bring to these important discussions as well.</p>

<p>Recently, Hasbro’s CEO mentioned exploring ways to <a href="https://www.enworld.org/threads/hasbro-ceo-chris-cocks-talks-ai-usage-in-d-d-updated.706638/" target="_blank">incorporate AI into D&amp;D</a>, which predictably caused a significant backlash. Many assumed this meant replacing creative teams with AI-generated content. However, it’s worth noting that this wasn’t explicitly stated, and there are numerous potential applications of AI that could enhance, rather than replace, the TTRPG experience.</p>

<p>While I share the community’s concerns about AI-generated books, adventures, or artwork, I believe we’re overlooking some genuinely beneficial uses of AI that could improve our gaming experiences. Let’s explore some of these possibilities:</p>

    <img class="img-fluid figure-img " src="/assets/img/ttrpg_players_and_robot_480x600.webp" alt="People playing dungeons and dragons with a robot looking on." height="600" width="480" />

<h3 id="1-a-dndbeyond-search-that-actually-works">1. A DnDBeyond Search that Actually Works!</h3>

<p>Imagine a D&amp;D Beyond with a truly functional search feature powered by AI. A Perplexity-like AI could revolutionize how we access and utilize the vast amount of information in the digital toolset. This would save DMs and players countless hours of frustration trying to locate specific rules, spells, or creature stats.  Extend this to your library of PDFs, GM Notes, and Campaign Logs and now you’ve got a truly useful personal assistant. <em>“Show me examples of area effect zones in grid based combat from the DMG.”</em></p>

<h3 id="2-lore-summarization">2. Lore Summarization</h3>

<p>One of the most exciting potential applications of AI in TTRPGs is summarizing published content. An AI chatbot that could provide concise summaries of lore from various settings like the Forgotten Realms, Dark Sun, or Eberron would be invaluable. This tool could help DMs quickly refresh their memory or give players a brief overview of a setting without spoiling key plot points. <em>“Summarize the history of the city of Waterdeep from the Dungeon Master’s Guide.”</em>, <em>“Give me a list of the named wizards from the city of Thay.”</em></p>

<h3 id="3-advanced-random-tables">3. Advanced Random Tables</h3>

<p>We already use random tables for various aspects of our games. AI could take this concept further, generating more complex and contextually appropriate random elements on the fly. This could include NPC personalities, location details, or even plot hooks that align with the current game state. Better yet, if you have access to your campaign notes you can do things like ask it to related a random encounter to a specific NPC or location. <em>“Generate a random encounter along the Triboar trail that involves bandits and smugglers and add a complication to the encounter based on the notes for the mountain gnome enclave.”</em></p>

<h3 id="4-game-management-assistant">4. Game Management Assistant</h3>

<p>AI could be a game-changer for the administrative side of running a TTRPG campaign. Imagine an AI assistant that helps with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Scheduling games and managing player availability</li>
  <li>Keeping track of session logs and important plot points</li>
  <li>Organizing campaign notes and player character information</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="5-vtt-scene-preparation-and-management">5. VTT Scene Preparation and Management</h3>

<p>Virtual Tabletop (VTT) platforms have opened up new possibilities for online play, but they’ve also increased the workload for DMs. An AI assistant could help streamline VTT preparation and management by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Suggesting appropriate maps and tokens based on the planned encounter</li>
  <li>Automating lighting and fog of war settings</li>
  <li>Handling initiative tracking and turn management</li>
</ul>

<p>This kind of AI integration could significantly reduce the time DMs spend wrestling with VTT logistics, allowing them to focus more on storytelling and player engagement.</p>

<h3 id="6-managing-characters-and-game-content">6. Managing Characters and Game Content</h3>

<p>At their core, TTRPGs are essentially analog databases. We constantly reference character abilities, skills, equipment, and various other game elements. This often involves tedious record-keeping and calculations that, while necessary, aren’t particularly enjoyable. AI opens up exciting new possibilities to streamline these processes and make our game data more accessible and useful.</p>

<p><strong>Character Sheet Management</strong></p>

<p>Imagine an AI assistant that can instantly provide you with any information from your character sheet, summarize it, transform it into a different format. Need to know your current load and carrying capacity? Just ask. Want a quick summary of all flammable items in your inventory? Need a version of your character with abilities after you’ve been polymorphed into a purple octopus? The AI can compile that for you in seconds.</p>

<p><strong>Equipment Details On-Demand</strong></p>

<p>Ever wondered exactly what’s in your component pouch or what that obscure magic item does? An AI could provide detailed breakdowns of equipment contents and magical properties on command. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“List all the components in my component pouch.”</li>
  <li>“What are the exact effects of the Ring of Spell Storing I just found?”</li>
  <li>“Calculate how many days of rations I can carry at my current strength.”</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Group Information Aggregation</strong></p>

<p>DMs often need to compile information about the entire party quickly. An AI assistant could be invaluable for this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Create a table with all characters’ ability modifiers, initiative bonuses, and passive perception scores.”</li>
  <li>“List all party members’ languages and their tool proficiencies.”</li>
  <li>“Summarize the party’s current inventory of healing potions and scrolls.”</li>
  <li>“I have 4 days of downtime and 300gp, what could I craft in that time?”</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Rules and Mechanics Clarification</strong></p>

<p>When disputes or questions about rules arise, an AI could quickly provide relevant information from the rulebooks, saving time spent leafing through pages or searching PDFs.</p>

<p><strong>Campaign Note Organization</strong></p>

<p>For DMs, keeping track of campaign notes, NPCs, and plot threads can be challenging. An AI assistant could help organize and recall this information effortlessly, allowing DMs to focus more on storytelling and less on bookkeeping.</p>

<ul>
  <li>“I need to know what plot threads I left open in the city of Thornwick.”</li>
  <li>“Give me a list of funny quotes from the campaign.”</li>
  <li>“Randomly remove 3 items from from the inventory of every character.”</li>
  <li>“I need to know what my party is currently carrying. Give me a compiled list of everything.”</li>
  <li>“What was the last mention of an NPC named Kaelin in the campaign notes?”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>While it’s crucial to remain vigilant about preserving the human creativity at the heart of TTRPGs, we shouldn’t dismiss AI entirely. By focusing on applications that enhance rather than replace human input, we can leverage AI to make our games more accessible, efficient, and enjoyable.</p>

<p>The key is to view AI as a tool that empowers DMs and players, not as a replacement for the imagination and storytelling that make our hobby unique. As we continue to explore the potential of AI in TTRPGs, let’s keep an open mind about how it can be used to elevate our gaming experiences while preserving the essence of what makes tabletop roleplaying special.</p>

<p>By leveraging AI for data management tasks, we can focus more on the creative and interactive aspects of the game. The tedious record-keeping becomes just a prompt away from being useful, allowing players and DMs to immerse themselves more fully in the storytelling and roleplaying experience.</p>

<p>It’s important to note that while AI can greatly enhance our ability to manage and access game information, it doesn’t replace the need for human decision-making and creativity. The AI serves as a powerful tool to support and streamline the game, allowing us to spend more time on the aspects of TTRPGs that we truly enjoy.</p>

While some argue that the inclusion of modern dishes like sushi and tacos breaks immersion, others welcome this expansion of the game’s aesthetics to make the setting familiar to more people. However, this debate overlooks a powerful worldbuilding tool: using food to create a deeper sense of culture and tradition in our fantasy worlds.</p>

<p>Food is a universal connector across cultures, and it can be an excellent vehicle for humanizing and adding depth to the communities in your TTRPG settings. This post will explore how to effectively use food descriptions to enhance your worldbuilding, providing concrete strategies and examples to implement in your games.</p>

<h2 id="the-power-of-food-in-worldbuilding">The Power of Food in Worldbuilding</h2>

    <img class="img-fluid figure-img " src="/assets/img/heroes-feast_480x302.webp" alt="A group of adventurers enjoying a hearty feast." height="302" width="480" />

</figure>

<p>Food can instantly create a sense of verisimilitude about the communities in your world. It’s not just about what people eat, but the particular styles and traditions behind it, which can suggest a great deal about a culture. Here are some key reasons why food is an effective worldbuilding tool:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Universal relatability</li>
  <li>Cultural signifier</li>
  <li>Historical context</li>
  <li>Social dynamics</li>
  <li>Environmental indicators</li>
</ol>

<p>By incorporating food into your descriptions, you can subtly convey information about all these aspects of your world.</p>

<h2 id="strategies-for-using-food-in-worldbuilding">Strategies for Using Food in Worldbuilding</h2>

<h3 id="1-describe-dont-label">1. Describe, Don’t Label</h3>

<p>The key to effective food-based worldbuilding is to let the player draw connections to the familiar without explicitly naming real-world dishes. Instead of saying “taco,” describe the dish:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Spiced meats nestled in a warm, soft flatbread”</li>
  <li>“Tender chunks of seasoned meat cradled in a folded, griddled cornmeal cake”</li>
  <li>“Sliced cooked vegitables in a rich sauce of light oils and spices, with a spongy bread used to grab and eat the dish.”</li>
</ul>

<p>This approach allows players to make connections while maintaining the fantasy atmosphere.</p>

<h3 id="2-use-food-to-hint-at-cultural-practices">2. Use Food to Hint at Cultural Practices</h3>

<p>Food preparation and consumption can reveal a lot about a culture. Consider the following examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A culture that values community might have traditions of communal cooking and shared meals</li>
  <li>A nomadic society might favor preserved foods and portable meals</li>
  <li>A hierarchical society might have strict rules about who can eat certain foods</li>
  <li>A society may have particular traditions about the use of animals as food</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="3-incorporate-food-into-religious-or-magical-practices">3. Incorporate Food into Religious or Magical Practices</h3>

<p>Food often plays a role in religious rituals and magical practices. Some ideas to consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sacred plants or animals that are never eaten</li>
  <li>Medicinal plants or animals that are always eaten</li>
  <li>Specific preparations required for magical ingredients</li>
  <li>Fasting or feasting traditions tied to religious observances</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="4-use-food-to-indicate-social-status">4. Use Food to Indicate Social Status</h3>

<p>What people eat can say a lot about their place in society. Think about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Rare or expensive ingredients reserved for the elite</li>
  <li>“Peasant foods” that become delicacies</li>
  <li>Taboos around certain foods for different social classes</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="5-let-food-reflect-the-environment">5. Let Food Reflect the Environment</h3>

<p>The available food can tell players a lot about the local environment. Consider:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Coastal regions with abundant seafood</li>
  <li>Arid areas with drought-resistant grains and preserved foods</li>
  <li>Lush forests with a variety of fruits and game meats</li>
  <li>Hot climates using spices and drying techniques for food preservation</li>
  <li>Cold climates relying on smoking, salting, and fermentation for food storage</li>
  <li>Temperate regions developing cheese-making and curing methods for dairy and meat preservation</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="implementing-food-based-worldbuilding">Implementing Food-Based Worldbuilding</h2>

<p>To effectively use these strategies in your game, consider the following steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Create a food profile for each major culture in your world</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>List three staple ingredients used in most meals</li>
      <li>Describe common cooking methods, unique tools, or how food is stored</li>
      <li>Note any significant food-related traditions of who can eat, what, and why</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Incorporate food descriptions into your scene-setting</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Describe smells and sounds of cooking in market scenes</li>
      <li>Mention what characters are eating during social interactions</li>
      <li>Highlight an NPCs preferences through how they eat their food (greedy, cautious, supiciously smell every bite, etc)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Use food as a plot device</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>A rare ingredient as a quest item</li>
      <li>Diplomatic incidents over unfamiliar food customs</li>
      <li>Poisoned feasts as a dramatic set-piece</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Encourage player engagement with food</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Ask players what their characters typically eat</li>
      <li>Allow cooking skill checks for mechanical benefits, like helping in negotiations</li>
      <li>Use food preferences as character development opportunities</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>By thoughtfully incorporating food into your worldbuilding, you can create a richer, more immersive experience for your players. This approach allows you to subtly convey cultural information without resorting to direct real-world analogues or risking the trivialization of actual cultures.</p>

<p>Remember, the goal is to create something new that feels familiar enough to be believable. By sprinkling in these culinary details, you’re not just describing food; you’re hinting at entire cultures and histories that can make your world come alive.</p>

<p>Next time you’re describing a feast in your game, consider how you can use food to paint a picture of your world’s cultures. It’s an excellent way to add depth to your game without breaking immersion.</p>

Whether you’re charging into battle, making daring escapes, or simply looking for a reliable way to haul your hard-earned loot, mounts are an essential part of any fantasy adventurer’s toolkit. They add a thrilling dimension to gameplay, especially during overland adventures where a simple yet engaging mounted combat system can elevate the excitement of your <a href="https://www.thearcanelibrary.com/pages/shadowdark" target="_blank">Shadowdark</a> game.</p>

<p>In the spirit of Shadowdark’s minimalist yet evocative style, I’ve crafted these concise rules for mounted combat and travel. They’re designed to seamlessly integrate with the Shadowdark TTRPG, offering a brief but descriptive framework that expands your options without bogging down gameplay.
These mounted combat rules are part of a larger project, where I’m compiling various travel-related mechanics. In addition to what you’ll find here, I’ve posted some rules for <a href="/2024/08/26/expanded-herb-list-for-shadowdark/">hebs &amp; foraging</a>, and will be writing some rules on setting up camps, and interactive travel. The goal is to create a comprehensive supplement that enriches your overland adventures in the Shadowdark universe.</p>

<p>I’m excited to share these rules with you and eager to hear your thoughts! Please reach out to me on <a href="https://x.com/optionalrule" target="_blank">X (Twitter)</a> to share your feedback, experiences, or suggestions. I’m also in the Shadowdark Discord, so hit me up there. Your input is invaluable as we continue to expand and refine the Shadowdark experience.</p>

<h2 id="the-power-of-a-trusty-steed">The Power of a Trusty Steed</h2>

<p>Crawling in Shadowdark is dangerous buisness, but it’s not always delving underground. A reliable mount can be the difference between glory and a cold, lonely grave in the dark forests and dangerous countryside. But how exactly do these majestic beasts enhance your combat prowess? Let’s break it down.</p>

<p>When you’re astride your mount, you gain a +1 bonus to hit with melee weapons. It’s amazing what a little extra height can do for your swing!</p>

<h4 id="charge">Charge!</h4>

<p>Wielding a polearm atop a charging mount? Add your mount’s Strength modifier to your damage. This devastating move requires a straight charge of at least Near distance.</p>

<p>But beware, brave rider! This tactic cuts both ways. If you’re on the receiving end of a charging foe while wielding a polearm, you can add the enemy mount’s Strength modifier to your damage to an attack on any rider that has charged you. It’s a high-risk, high-reward situation!</p>

<h4 id="mounted-movement">Mounted Movement</h4>

<p>When mounted, you use your trusty steed’s movement as your own. This can significantly increase your tactical options on the battlefield or help you outrun that pesky goblin that’s been tailing you… Let’s just hope they don’t have shortbows.</p>

<h4 id="the-perils-of-riding">The Perils of Riding</h4>

<p>However, mounted combat isn’t all glory and triumph. There are risks to consider:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Bolting</strong>: If your mount gets spooked (either by fright or by taking half its hit points in damage), you’ll need to make a Morale check. Fail, and your mount bolts, carrying you away from the fray—whether you like it or not!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Staying Ahorse</strong>: When your mount rears or stumbles, you’ll need to make a hard Strength check to avoid being thrown. No proper saddle? You’re rolling with disadvantage, cowboy.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Unseating a Rider</strong>: Enemies can try to knock you off your high horse with a contested Strength check. You get advantage on your roll, but if you fail, it’s a long way down.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="burdens-carry-capacity-of-mounts">Burdens: Carry Capacity of Mounts</h3>

<p>Mounts are not just for riding; they’re excellent pack animals too:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Riderless mounts can carry triple the normal Gear Slots.</li>
  <li>Mounts with riders use standard Gear Slots.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>(For more details on Gear Slots, check out page 35 of the Shadowdark rulebook.)</em></p>

<h2 id="gearing-up-your-mount">Gearing Up Your Mount</h2>

<p>Mounts require a bit of gear and care. Tack is generally required to ride or guide a mount, and all actions are at disadvantage without it. Barding is available to safeguard your mount in battle, but only War horses can wear Chain or Plate. While most mounts can forage in a normal or wooded environment, they’ll need Feed to gain the benefits of a rest.</p>

This belief, while understandable, couldn’t be further from the truth. From its earliest days, DnD was designed with roleplaying at its core—a distinction that set it apart from the wargames that preceded it. Sure, early DnD had its share of combat (often brutal and unforgiving), but if you think it was all about kicking down doors and hacking away at monsters, you’ve missed the point, and probably rolled a lot of new characters. The truth is, combat was risky, and survival often depended on players being more thoughtful, more cunning. Roleplaying wasn’t an option; it was a necessity, at least in the way early DnD framed it but more on that later. <em>Many of the early modules assumed players would be talking, negotiating, and thinking their way out of danger as often than they’d be fighting.</em></p>

<h3 id="the-assumptions-behind-early-roleplaying">The Assumptions Behind Early Roleplaying</h3>

<p>Modern gamers didn’t invent roleplaying—they inherited it. However, it’s fair to say that what we now consider “roleplaying” has evolved significantly since the earliest days of DnD. Back then, roleplaying was less about theatrical performance and more about practical problem-solving and character goals. The roots of DnD in wargaming meant that much of the roleplaying was centered around diplomacy, negotiation, and building relationships—things that didn’t need a lot of rules because the system trusted players to bring their own creativity to the table.</p>

<p>Characters in early DnD didn’t have a list of skills to guide them. They didn’t have a “persuasion” or “Insight” roll to determine if they could talk their way out of trouble or detect lies. The system didn’t do the thinking for the player. Instead, it was up to the players to decide what their characters would do in any given situation. Want to negotiate a truce between two warring factions? That’s on you, the player, to figure out. The DM was there to adjudicate the outcome, but the process was driven entirely by the player’s ideas and actions. This was a FEATURE of the early game design and one of the reasons I find games with an OG design philosophy like <a href="https://www.thearcanelibrary.com/pages/shadowdark" target="_blank">Shadowdark</a> so compelling. I think others do as well, which is why there is such an explosion of <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/browse?legFilter1=45582" target="_blank">OSR games</a>, each with it’s own community and appeal.</p>

<p><em>Skills were not included in these early editions because it was assumed the characters thoughts, talents, goals, and decisions were entirely the domain of the player, with help from the DM to fit them to the setting.</em>  This was not seen as the domain of the rules, and some can credibly argue that the introduction of skills deminished that.  More on that below.</p>

<p>As proof, I offer you the early classic adventures of B/X and AD&amp;D, where roleplaying and negotiation were front and center:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>B2: The Keep on the Borderlands (1979)</strong>: Here, the Caves of Chaos are populated by various humanoid tribes, and players are encouraged to negotiate or manipulate these groups. Forming alliances wasn’t just possible—it was an assumed strategy for success. I know this module was selected as the basis for the new DnD 2024 Starter Kit and I don’t think it was an accident. I expect the negotiation and roleplaying elements are a big part of why this selected.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>T1: The Village of Hommlet (1979)</strong>: The village itself is teeming with NPCs who have their own motivations and secrets. The players are expected to engage with these NPCs, gather information, and solve the underlying mysteries—diplomacy and social interaction were key.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>X1: The Isle of Dread (1981)</strong>: This module blends exploration with opportunities for diplomacy. Players can negotiate with native factions, and how they handle these interactions can dramatically affect their survival.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>I1: Dwellers of the Forbidden City (1981)</strong>: The Forbidden City is a complex environment where factions vie for power. Players can navigate this web of intrigue through negotiation, making roleplaying a crucial component of the adventure.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>L1: The Secret of Bone Hill (1981)</strong>: Restenford, the town featured in this module, is a hotbed of NPC interaction. Players are encouraged to investigate and solve local mysteries by engaging with the townsfolk—again, roleplaying takes the lead.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>A1: Slave Pits of the Undercity (1980)</strong>: Although this series is known for its combat, A1 offers opportunities for infiltration, negotiation, and deception. Players can choose to engage slavers diplomatically, leveraging social skills over combat.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>C1: The Hidden Shrine of Tamoachan (1980)</strong>: Survival in this module often hinges on the players’ ability to think creatively and roleplay effectively. It’s not just about fighting—it’s about engaging with the world in a way that bypasses danger.  This is perfect as a “survival and planning as roleplaying” type of module where action isn’t just funny quips and voices.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>S1: Tomb of Horrors (1978)</strong>: This infamous module is packed with deadly traps, but it also demands intellectual engagement. Players must decipher clues and solve puzzles through roleplaying and creative thinking. So even the glassic “meat grinder” module itself, at least assumed a heavy amount of though from the point of view of the character.  Again, roleplaying isn’t just about what a character says, it’s about what a character thinks and why.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>B3: Palace of the Silver Princess (1981)</strong>: The palace is home to various factions, and players can navigate the adventure through diplomacy and alliance-building. Roleplaying is essential to making it through this module.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>These examples make it clear: Roleplaying wasn’t just an optional extra in early DnD—it was baked into the design. The game expected players to engage with the world and its inhabitants in dynamic, creative ways, using their characters’ social skills just as much as their swords.</p>

<h3 id="something-gained-and-something-lost">Something Gained and Something Lost</h3>

<p>As DnD and TTRPGs have evolved, we’ve gained a lot in terms of narrative depth and character development. Today’s games often put a stronger emphasis on storytelling, character backstories, and interpersonal dynamics. This shift towards a more narrative-driven form of roleplaying has brought a richness and emotional depth that I personally enjoy.</p>

<p>But is it better? It’s hard to say. On one hand, the theatricality of modern roleplaying can be incredibly rewarding when done right, creating immersive and memorable experiences. On the other hand, it’s fair to acknowledge that this shift has come with some trade-offs. The rise of skill rolls and predefined abilities has made problem-solving more about mechanics than player creativity. In the early days, the game required players to think, plan, and strategize their way through challenges, often through group discussion and collective decision-making. Today, roleplaying can sometimes feel more like a series of individual performances rather than a collaborative effort.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>I’m not saying one way is better than the other, but I do think we’ve lost sight of some of the core elements that made early DnD what it was. Roleplaying was always a central pillar of the game, and it didn’t need the elaborate systems we see today. Instead, it relied on the players’ own ingenuity and the social dynamic at the table. In moving towards a more performative style of roleplaying, we’ve gained a lot, but we’ve also left something behind. It’s worth remembering that the strategic, puzzle-solving aspect of the game—the part where players had to think their way through a problem—was just as important as the roleplaying itself. And in losing that, we may have lost a bit of the magic that made the early game so special.</p>]]></content><author><name>Scott Turnbull</name></author><category term="RPG Resources" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Uncover how early D&D modules emphasized roleplaying, diplomacy, and problem-solving, shaping the evolution of the game from its wargaming roots.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://www.optionalrule.com/assets/img/keep-on-the-borderlands_480x621.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://www.optionalrule.com/assets/img/keep-on-the-borderlands_480x621.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry></feed>
