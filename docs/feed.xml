By infusing combat with the possibility of enduring consequences, this elevates the significance of each skirmish beyond the individual encounter. Health is no longer just hit points to be replenished with the wave of a hand or a nap; it becomes a strategic element of play managed through clever player choices. This shift introduces a layer of tactical depth missing in the vanilla game, requiring players to think critically about their characters actions and their potential long-term impacts on how the adventure plays out.</p>

<p>An enhanced focus on increasing tension through lasting injuries does more than just increase stakes; it weaves a tighter bond between the player characters. Characters are encouraged build allies and actively participate in the healing and protection of their comrades, adding a rich layer of interdependence that was somewhat underdeveloped in the core rules. The sense of triumph following a narrowly won battle is exponentially heightened when the victory is hard-earned and comes with its own set of challenges to overcome. Through this approach, Dungeons and Dragons 5th edition rekindles the flame of classic sword and sorcery adventures, making every step of the journey feel impactful and every success a testament to the players’ strategic prowess and camaraderie.</p>

<h2 id="exhaustion-condition-and-the-modern-adventurer">Exhaustion Condition and the Modern Adventurer</h2>

<p>The D&amp;D design team presented an intriguing update to the exhaustion rules during their <a href="https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/one-dnd/expert-classes/kpx0MvyfBGHe0XKk/UA2022-Expert-Classes.pdf">Expert Class Unearthed Arcana Playtest</a> in 2022. In it, they replaced the confusing six-level exhaustion rules, which many thought were useless and confusing, with a more gradual system adding a simple -1 per level of exhaustion. A typical house rule in many D&amp;D games has been to add a level of exhaustion to each character who drops to 0 HP or fails a death save. Using a similar house rule with this new Exhaustion Condition, but requires a bit more thought and modification to make it enjoyable, manageable, and fit well into the game.</p>

<p>Having never included the Exhausted Condition in subsequent UA releases, it looks like this may not be included in the DnD 2024 update, set to release later this year.  Possibly they may make it into the DMG as an optional rule, but this expansion adjusts to the rules change in a way that integrates better with class abilities and the intent of the overall rules. It also integrates with the natural and mechanical healing rules in a natural way.</p>

<p>To that end, I suggest the following house rule I have been refining over the last year. (You may have seen some of my previous injury condition posts).</p>

<h3 id="exhausted-condition">Exhausted [Condition]</h3>

<p>Characters accumulate exhaustion through various means that slowly reduce their effectiveness.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Levels of Exhaustion.</strong> Exhaustion is cumulative. Each time a character receives the condition, they gain 1 level of exhaustion. A character may have a maximum of 10 levels of exhaustion and die once they exceed that. As an optional rule, the DM may choose to use the character’s CON score as the maximum level of exhaustion.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>d20 Rolls Affected.</strong> The character subtracts their levels of exhaustion from all d20 tests.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Spell Save DCs Affected.</strong> The character subtracts their level of exhaustion from their spell save DCs for any spell they personally cast.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Gaining the Condition.</strong> A character gains 1 level of exhaustion whenever they fail a death save or when they suffer a critical hit. For purposes of Revivify and similar abilities (see more below), characters killed through the Massive Damage rules gain their maximum level of exhaustion. The DM may also rule a character acquires a level of fatigue though other means like strenuous activity, difficult travel, or other circumstances.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Recovering.</strong> A character removes 1 level of exhaustion per Long Rest. When their exhaustion level reaches 0, they are no longer exhausted.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Recovering.</strong> (Optional Variant) Immediately after finishing a Long Rest, the character may make a DC 10 Constitution test, removing 1 level of exhaustion on a success. Characters who fail by rolling a 1 gain an additional exhaustion level. A character may gain advantage on a recovery roll if they are being provided medical care, provided hot meals, and in a restful environment, or other conditions as determined by the DM. Characters without adequate shelter or in a very stressful environment roll recovery at disadvantage. When their exhaustion level reaches 0, the character is no longer injured.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="class-ability">Class Ability</h4>

<p><strong>Shake It Off.</strong> Fighters, Paladins, Barbarians, Monks, and Rangers gain the ‘Shake It Off’ ability at 1st level. As a free action, the character can choose to tap their deep reserves of fortitude to prevent taking one level of exhaustion. They can use this ability once and regain the ability to do so after a Long Rest. These classes gain an additional use of Shake It Off each time they gain the Extra Attack ability.</p>

<h4 id="magic">Magic</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Healing Exhaustion with Magic.</strong> One level of exhaustion may be removed by casting Lesser Restoration. Greater Restoration removes all levels of exhaustion.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Bring Out Your Dead.</strong> Any levels of exhaustion remain with a character brought back to life through Revivify or Raise Dead, up to their maximum. Resurrection, True Resurrection, and Wish bring characters back to life with 0 levels of exhaustion.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="much-ado-about-death-spirals">Much Ado about Death Spirals</h2>

<p>Some express a concern of creating a “Death Spiral” through cumulative injury rules, where penalties lead to further failures in a seemingly endless cycle, is valid yet potentially overstated in the context of these new exhaustion mechanics. The incremental nature of a -1 penalty per level of exhaustion allows for a gradual impact, delaying significant detriment until several levels are accumulated. Moreover, mid-level characters possess abilities such as Bardic Inspiration or Aid, offering strategic options to offset penalties. Additionally, the game does not operate in isolation; DMs can incorporate downtime for recovery, and players can proactively seek rest, fostering deeper engagement with the game world. Thus, while vigilance is necessary to prevent overwhelming challenges, these rules are designed to enrich gameplay, not hinder it.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>In conclusion, incorporating and expanding the exhaustion rules in a Dungeons and Dragons game adds a whole new layer of strategic depth and emotional engagement. It elevates the stakes of every combat encounter, pushing players to think more critically about their actions and encouraging a greater sense of camaraderie within the party. This not only enhances the realism of the game but also enriches the storytelling, creating a more immersive and memorable experience. While it’s a more challenging way to play, the rewards are substantial, making each victory a testament to the players’ resilience and teamwork.</p>]]></content><author><name>Scott Turnbull</name></author><category term="RPG Resources" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Explore gritty DnD 5e injuries, adding strategic depth and encouraging camaraderie without spiraling into defeat.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://www.optionalrule.com/assets/img/wounded_ranger_480x600.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://www.optionalrule.com/assets/img/wounded_ranger_480x600.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Yes, if … the true secret of crafting adventures</title><link href="https://www.optionalrule.com/2023/12/20/the-magic-of-yes-if/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Yes, if … the true secret of crafting adventures" /><published>2023-12-20T14:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-12-20T14:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://www.optionalrule.com/2023/12/20/the-magic-of-yes-if</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.optionalrule.com/2023/12/20/the-magic-of-yes-if/"><![CDATA[<p>In Dungeons &amp; Dragons, a common practice among Dungeon Masters (DMs) is to hand-wave new rulings for the sake of convenience, or with the belief that they’re enhancing the game by simply saying yes. However, I’ve come to realize that this approach, while seemingly beneficial, may actually be more limiting than many of us think. Simple answers keep things moving but ignore the fundamental truth about creating adventures. Running a TTRPG isn’t just about adjudicating the rules, it’s about creating opportunities for characters to risk it all to pursue their goals. Every question asked in a game is an opportunity to create a new adventure, so let’s talk a bit about this.</p>

<figure class="figure float-end ms-4">

<h3 id="the-underappreciated-art-of-saying-no">The Underappreciated Art of Saying No</h3>

<p>The art of saying “no” in modern D&amp;D doesn’t get the appreciation it deserves. A straightforward “yes” can be a quick fix, a way to feel good in the moment because it seems like we’re enabling our players, who in turn feel gratified for getting their way. But this isn’t the kind of game-play that fosters deep enjoyment or lasting investment. It’s a basic facet of human psychology: the easy win often fails to satisfy in the long run.</p>

<p>Additionally, it ignores the very important role the rules play. That is to define a common core experience for everyone at the table. Establishing a common and consistent vision of how the world works is an extremely important element of creating any shared experience. Tossing that aside with a simple yes, while easier, undermines the shared experience.</p>

<p><strong>But while “No” is a complete sentence, it also doesn’t mean things have to end there.</strong></p>

<h3 id="the-missed-opportunity-in-the-simple-answer">The Missed Opportunity in the Simple Answer</h3>

<p>While saying “yes” or “no” can keep the game moving and be an adequate solution in some cases, I believe we’re missing a significant opportunity. Rulings that fall into the grey areas – the edge cases – offer a golden chance to weave new elements into the world and present challenges to players by creating new adventures. Imagine a scenario where learning a new technique, acquiring a magical item, or forming a bond with a key character becomes part of the quest. These are opportunities to use abilities in innovative ways, enriching the game’s narrative.</p>

<p><strong>From a DM’s point of view, the best answer to every question isn’t a yes or no, it’s a new adventure.</strong></p>

<h3 id="yes-if-vs-yes-and-and-yes-but">“Yes, If…” vs. “Yes, And” and “Yes, But”</h3>

<p>Many advocate for “Yes, and” or “Yes, but” as the secret sauce to effective GMing. While these approaches have their merits, I propose that “Yes, if…” holds significantly more potential value for a game. The phrases “and” and “but” often lead to immediate, transactional outcomes, which, though useful, don’t contribute substantially to the overall adventure. On the other hand, <strong>“Yes, if…” places the onus back on the players, challenging them to pursue something more, to push their boundaries and achieve new results.</strong></p>

<p><em>As a single example, I had a player in my D&amp;D game who believed they could counterspell an ability if they had the same spell prepared. That’s not how it works, and I wasn’t going to rewrite the entire counterspell system on a whim. However, the player was communicating something they thought was interesting to me, so I would be a fool to ignore it. So, I had them make a history roll to recall writings of wizards who seemed to have been able to do this, and they could find out more by researching in the library at Candlekeep. This led to an entire adventure to recover lost lore of that Wizard order who could modify their spell focus to give them this ability. Ruling-wise, it was just a bound magic item. The whole thing worked out very well and it gave the entire party a new adventure to pursue.</em></p>

<p>(For the record, I realize ‘Yes, if…’ is just ‘No, but …’ in disguise but keeping things framed as a yes is powerful to frame things in the players mind as an opportunity.)</p>

<h3 id="the-real-thrill-of-dd-beyond-convenience">The Real Thrill of D&amp;D: Beyond Convenience</h3>

<p>By resorting to easy rulings for the sake of convenience, we risk diluting the true excitement of D&amp;D. The essence of the game lies in using every opportunity to create new adventures, presenting challenges that players can overcome and be rewarded for. “Yes, if…” is more than just a response; it’s a philosophy that encourages deeper engagement, creativity, and a richer gaming experience.</p>

<p>In conclusion, embracing the “Yes, if…” approach can transform our D&amp;D sessions from simple pastimes into epic adventures filled with meaningful challenges and rewarding experiences.</p>]]></content><author><name>Scott Turnbull</name></author><category term="RPG Resources" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Discover how flexible D&D rulings enhance gameplay, as a DM turns a player's unique counterspell idea into an exciting new adventure.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://www.optionalrule.com/assets/img/A_group_playing_a_TTRPG_togeher_480x581.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://www.optionalrule.com/assets/img/A_group_playing_a_TTRPG_togeher_480x581.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Unlocking the Magic of TTRPG Design</title><link href="https://www.optionalrule.com/2023/12/11/guidelines-for-great-ttrpg-design/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Unlocking the Magic of TTRPG Design" /><published>2023-12-11T12:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-12-11T12:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://www.optionalrule.com/2023/12/11/guidelines-for-great-ttrpg-design</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.optionalrule.com/2023/12/11/guidelines-for-great-ttrpg-design/"><![CDATA[<p>Brandon Sanderson, celebrated for his exceptional worldbuilding and intricate <a href="https://faq.brandonsanderson.com/knowledge-base/what-are-sandersons-laws-of-magic/" target="_blank">magic system design</a>, stands out as a titan in modern fantasy literature. His principles, while crafted for literary creation, offer invaluable insights for TTRPG design. In an era brimming with new TTRPG systems being developed and crowdfunded, I frequently ponder how Sanderson’s concepts could shape better game design, or at least preserve a diversity in gaming experiences rather than  yet another play on heroic-fantasy without risk of failure. Specifically, I contemplate the potential of these foundational ideas to captivate players through effective game design—a crucial aspect often missed in the foundational design of many emerging games.</p>

<p><strong>Sanderson’s Guidelines for Creating a Compelling Magic System</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>An author’s ability to resolve conflicts with magic is directly proportional to how well the reader understands that magic.</li>
  <li>Weaknesses, limits, and costs are more intriguing than powers.</li>
  <li>Authors should first expand on existing elements of the magic system before adding entirely new aspects, as these could significantly alter how the system integrates into the fictional world.</li>
</ol>

<p>I often reflect on this in relation to TTRPG system design, especially given the influx of new systems that emphasize powers and abilities, downplaying failure as a core aspect of Heroic Fantasy. This trend seemed to gain momentum during the 5e D&amp;D era, as the notion that any form of failure was undesirable began to surface in online discussions. However, I believe this line of thinking leads to uninspired and uninteresting game design.</p>

<h3 id="the-heroic-fantasy-conundrum">The Heroic Fantasy Conundrum</h3>
<p>We’re in an era of evolving TTRPG landscapes, marked by a trend of assuming powers and minimizing the role of failure. It seems like everyone wants to be Hercules without the trials and tribulations. This shift, gaining traction in the 5e D&amp;D era, rendered the concept of failure almost taboo in some gaming circles.</p>

<p>It’s important to note that Heroic Fantasy traditionally involves risks and the possibility of failure. The recent shift away from these elements is a modern deviation, but let’s not get sidetracked by that right now.</p>

<p>The best tales are spun from sacrifice, struggle, and the looming threat of defeat. These elements are the lifeblood of drama, action, and even comedy. So, how do we craft TTRPG systems that embrace these aspects?</p>

<h3 id="creating-worlds-that-thrive-on-challenge">Creating Worlds That Thrive on Challenge</h3>
<p>A well-designed TTRPG is more than just rolling dice and casting spells. It involves creating engaging group gameplay and weaving a narrative rich with compelling storytelling elements – be it risky decisions, character flaws, or facing daunting obstacles. The tension arising from these interactions is what elevates a game, and systems designed to leverage these elements can foster some of the most rewarding experiences at the gaming table.</p>

<p><strong>Optional Rule’s Guidelines for Creating a Compelling TTRPG</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>The depth of a player’s immersion is a function of how well the system fosters meaningful interactions within the game world.</li>
  <li>The best TTRPG experiences arise from grappling with limitations, creatively offsetting weaknesses, and skillfully navigating the ever-present risk of failure.</li>
  <li>A compelling system is captivating through the intricate interplay of existing subsystems, rather than through the addition of new ones.</li>
</ol>

<p>There isn’t just one way to design a good TTRPG, and it seems we’ve lost sight of that. In a race to create the most ‘heroic’ designs, the importance of struggle and success as core elements of good game design has been overlooked. There should still be room in the hobby for systems that embrace these challenges. Being overshadowed by ‘easy-mode’ systems, where players never fail, isn’t beneficial for the hobby. I hope more designers will consider these guidelines in their creations, and I also hope the community discussion will acknowledge the importance of this type of system design, recognizing the need for a variety of philosophies in game design.</p>]]></content><author><name>Scott Turnbull</name></author><category term="RPG Resources" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Explore how Brandon Sanderson's magic system principles can revolutionize TTRPG design for deeper, more engaging gameplay experiences.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://www.optionalrule.com/assets/img/dice_and_eberron_480x640.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://www.optionalrule.com/assets/img/dice_and_eberron_480x640.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">DMing is not a Covert Power Grab</title><link href="https://www.optionalrule.com/2023/11/27/dming-isnt-a-conspiracy-to-control-you/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="DMing is not a Covert Power Grab" /><published>2023-11-27T13:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-11-27T13:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://www.optionalrule.com/2023/11/27/dming-isnt-a-conspiracy-to-control-you</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.optionalrule.com/2023/11/27/dming-isnt-a-conspiracy-to-control-you/"><![CDATA[<p>The DM is the First Mover in any Dungeons &amp; Dragons campaign. It’s not that they’re superior or more important; rather, the game hinges on the DM’s involvement. As the game’s primary driving force, DMs significantly influence its tone and genre. Moreover, since they orchestrate the world, it naturally reflects their point of view and judgment. This aspect of game-running is a feature, not a flaw. While it’s perfectly valid for players to have preferences about the game’s style, the DM’s creative perspective is not inherently wrong.</p>

<figure class="figure float-end ms-4">
    
    <img class="img-fluid figure-img " src="/assets/img/A_group_playing_a_TTRPG_togeher_480x581.png" alt="A group of adventurers playing a game together." height="581" width="480" />
    
    
</figure>

<p>Many people seem uncomfortable with this reality, but it’s time to accept it. <strong>DMing is not a covert power grab</strong>; it’s a role undertaken for enjoyment and creative fulfillment. Often, DMs step into this role simply because they cannot find a suitable game, so they opt to create one. <em>This is not a conspiracy; it’s how games get played</em>.</p>

<p>D&amp;D 5e reiterated a social norm that has been integral to DMing since the hobby’s inception. Informally known as “Rule 0,” the <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/introduction#TheDungeonMaster" target="_blank">core rules state</a>: <em>“The rules aren’t in charge. You, the Dungeon Master, are the final arbiter of the rules.”</em> However, it also advises the DM to maintain consistency in rulings and ensure players understand the decisions and applied rules. This highlights that while DMs may initiate the game, its success depends on player engagement. All TTRPGs  are inherently collaborative experiences.</p>

<p>“<a href="https://media.wizards.com/2023/downloads/dnd/Peril_in_Pinebrook_COMPLETE.pdf" target="_blank">Perils in Pinebrook</a>,” the latest D&amp;D adventure, subtly but significantly modifies Rule 0. This adventure explicitly includes a new version of Rule 0:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong class="card blockquote blockquote-caption fst-italic text-center p-3"><em>“Rule 0 of D&amp;D is simple: Have fun. It’s fine if everyone agrees to change the rules, as long as doing so makes the game more enjoyable for everyone.”</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>While this statement captures the essence of gaming, it doesn’t fully acknowledge the typical process of game formation and momentum building. DMs usually originate the campaign or game idea, developing it until it’s robust enough to present to players. This isn’t a scheme to control players; it’s a natural part of the creative process. Of course, DMs must entice potential players with their game, revising their ideas if necessary to attract the desired audience. However, suggesting that DMs need player approval before even formulating their campaign idea could be detrimental, especially for new DMs.</p>

<p>Additionally, this shift underscores what many perceive as a troubling trend in the evolution of DnD in recent years. The core game, rather than uniting players, appears to be setting the community against itself, fostering an atmosphere of mutual suspicion and policing. While no single change in the game is solely responsible for this, there seems to be an aspect of DnD’s development that inadvertently caters to the ‘social point-scoring’ behavior rampant in online cultures. Although the underlying intentions behind these changes are commendable, it’s crucial to recognize how toxic elements of online culture can exploit these changes in ways detrimental to the hobby.</p>

<p>Games are inherently about negotiation, but the initial idea must come from someone. Observing this rule and the evolving toxic behaviors on social media, I see a potential for harm. There’s a risk that some community segments might expect DMs to seek permission for their ideas, potentially stifling games before they begin.</p>]]></content><author><name>Scott Turnbull</name></author><category term="rpg resources" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Explore how the DM's role as the First Mover shapes DnD games, impacts player dynamics, and evolves with changing rules and online culture.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://www.optionalrule.com/assets/img/A_group_playing_a_TTRPG_togeher_480x581.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://www.optionalrule.com/assets/img/A_group_playing_a_TTRPG_togeher_480x581.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">The Statistical Mirage of Advantage in D&amp;amp;D 5th Edition</title><link href="https://www.optionalrule.com/2023/11/09/the-advantage-of-knowing-modifiers/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Statistical Mirage of Advantage in D&amp;amp;D 5th Edition" /><published>2023-11-09T14:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-11-09T14:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://www.optionalrule.com/2023/11/09/the-advantage-of-knowing-modifiers</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.optionalrule.com/2023/11/09/the-advantage-of-knowing-modifiers/"><![CDATA[<p>Adventurers, gather ‘round the table as we delve into the often misunderstood mechanics of Advantage in Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5th Edition. Introduced as a streamlined method of bonus handling, Advantage allows players to roll a second d20 and choose the higher of the two. On the surface, it seems like a boon to the dice-rolling hopefuls, offering a second arrow in the quiver of chance. But does it truly elevate the players’ prospects, or is it a statistical sleight of hand?</p>

<p>Let’s address the elephant in the room—the Gambler’s Fallacy. This is the mistaken belief that a second roll inherently increases the likelihood of a higher result. Players often fall victim to this misconception, envisioning that elusive natural 20 as just one more roll away. Yet, the truth lies in the principle of Regression to the Mean, which, stripped of its mathematical grandeur, implies that rolling additional d20s is more likely to yield a result closer to the average of 10.5 than the peaks of 20 or the valleys of 1.</p>
<figure class="figure float-end ms-4 clearfix p-3 mb-3">
    
    <img class="img-fluid figure-img " src="/assets/img/PlayerWithDiceAndPaper.jpg" alt="A player confused by dice rolls." height="480" width="480" />
    
    
</figure>
<p>Imagine the collective sigh of disappointment if, instead of rolling for Advantage, we declared, “Assume you rolled a 10.” Not very heroic, is it? And yet, statistically, that’s closer to reality. Yes, Advantage provides a statistical bonus, but its impact is heavily skewed by the Difficulty Class (DC) of the task at hand. Lower DCs see an outsized benefit, inflating success rates on tasks that already favored the player, while the effect diminishes as the DC climbs. At a certain point, other bonuses, such as Bardic Inspiration, outshine Advantage, offering more consistent aid against the steeper challenges that heroes should face.</p>

<p>This is precisely where the design of 5th Edition stumbles. By tailoring the system around a DC threshold that rarely exceeds 15, it inadvertently shackles Dungeon Masters, constraining the breadth of difficulty and tension that can be woven into the campaign narrative. We find ourselves in a narrow corridor of challenge, where the drama of high stakes is dulled by the statistical safety net of Advantage.</p>

<p>Moreover, the non-stacking nature of Advantage and Disadvantage further complicates the battlefield. Once you’re locked in the grip of either, any additional factors that would normally tilt the scales become null and void. The result? A disincentive for players to seek creative solutions or take dynamic actions in combat. Why strive for that high ground or cunning feint if your current state of Disadvantage negates any potential benefits? Conversely, why not throw caution to the wind with a whimsical tactic if you’re already basking in the glow of Advantage?</p>

<p>In my 2021 article, “<a href="/2021/01/02/tools-for-effecting-rolls-in-dd/">Tools for Effecting Rolls</a>,” I explored various mechanisms that can influence dice outcomes. The insights gleaned there are particularly pertinent when considering Advantage’s place within the broader spectrum of roll-affecting tools available to players and DMs alike.</p>

<p>For the mathematically curious, the granular details of Advantage’s statistical effects are laid bare in an analysis I’ve set up on AnyDice, which you can explore <a href="https://anydice.com/program/32df7" target="_blank">here</a>. This model elucidates how Advantage impacts roll outcomes across different DCs, providing a clear visual representation of the mechanic’s limitations.</p>

<p>In conclusion, while Advantage was conceived as a simplification, its implications reverberate through the game, subtly undermining both the thrill of chance and the strategic depth of combat. It’s a mechanic that promises heroics but often delivers predictability, a comfort blanket that smothers the flames of daring when it should be fanning them. As we continue to craft our tales of valor and villainy, it’s worth pondering how to elevate our encounters beyond the realm of the ordinary—where the roll of the die is as unpredictable and exciting as the adventures we imagine.</p>]]></content><author><name>Scott Turnbull</name></author><category term="Analysis" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Adventurers, gather ‘round the table as we delve into the often misunderstood mechanics of Advantage in Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5th Edition.

Now, that’s what I call top-notch Dungeon Mastering in Dungeons and Dragons. Inspired by a spirited discussion over on Reddit, I’ve crafted the dungeon you’re about to delve into. My hope? That you’ll find it a thrilling addition to your campaign. The premise is versatile enough to slide right into numerous D&amp;D storylines, whenever innocents have perished in the course of an adventure. An all too common occurrence in most campaigns.</p>

<p><strong>Setup</strong>: Your players, in the thick of battle or perhaps a morally grey situation, have inadvertently caused the death of innocent bystanders. Little do they know, one of the fallen had a sibling: a devoted warlock bound to a mysterious fey from the <a href="https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Shadowfell" target="_blank">Shadowfell</a>. Recognizing the warlock’s anguish, this fey bestows the dungeon you’re about to explore as a “gift” to their loyal servant. Whether your players stumble upon it by sheer chance, through haunting dreams, or any other creative twist you fancy, is all up to you.</p>

<p>This small dungeon is set up assuming a party of 5th level characters but mix and match to your group’s needs.</p>

</figure>

<p><strong>Dungeon Theme</strong>: <em>A Grieving Mind</em> - The dungeon is a representation of the vengeful sibling’s psyche. Each section is a manifestation of his grief, anger, and quest for vengeance. This gives you the chance to use environmental dangers, narrative encounters, and emotional challenges instead of relying heavily on traps.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Entrance - Mourning</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>The entrance is surrounded by soft weeping echoes. Ghostly apparitions of the deceased peasant show their last moments, playing on a loop.</li>
      <li><strong>Enemies</strong> - 5 <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17010-shadow" target="_blank">Shadows</a> (Yes, the CR is low but with the environmental effect I think it’s fine. Particularly for the first encounter.)</li>
      <li><strong>Environmental Hazard</strong>: A fog slows movement by half, and characters must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw at the start of each round or be overwhelmed by feelings of guilt (disadvantage on attacks and checks).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Second Chamber - Anger</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>The large chamber pulses with a fiery rage. Walls appear to be made of burning embers, and the heat is stifling. A guttural sound of someone screaming in rage periodically emanates from a random location in the room where flame erupts.</li>
      <li><strong>Enemies</strong>: None</li>
      <li><strong>Environmental Hazard</strong>: A jagged and uneven chamber, the players must succeed on 3 DC 13 Athletics or Acrobatics checks to successfully cross the room.  Each failure results in 1d10 fire damage.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Third Chamber - Reflection</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>A vast underground lake where the surface acts as a mirror, showing each adventurer their reflection committing their worst mistakes or sins. The players must traverse a narrow stone pathway that sits just at the lakes water level.</li>
      <li><strong>Enemies</strong>: <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17208-water-weird" target="_blank">Water Weird</a> (see below)</li>
      <li><strong>Encounter</strong>: Each character sees their reflection in the surface of the water and is challenged by it, not as combatants but with questions and accusations, challenging their morals and decisions. If the character tries to respond and defend themselves, they must pass a DC 13 Persuasion check. For every 2 characters that either fail the check, or do not attempt to defend themselves, 1 Water Weird appears and tries to drag a character into the water and drown them. (min 1)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Fourth Chamber - Descent into Madness</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>A twisting labyrinth filled with whispering voices that doubt and belittle the adventurers, trying to make them doubt themselves. The environment and encounter are a recreation of whatever scene originally initiated this dungeon. For example, a party that fights a group of Kobolds but failed to stop them from sacrificing a group of peasants will encounter that scenario again.</li>
      <li><strong>Enemies</strong>: (Whatever enemy the group originally fought)</li>
      <li><strong>Encounter</strong>: The core of this encounter is for the players to relive the original encounter, this time randomly being transformed into the bystanders that lost their lives to realize the experience those people went through.  The characters have a hard time holding onto their sense of self. At the beginning of each round, the player must pass a DC 13 CHA save or be turned into a bystander for a round and are limited to the Commoners stat block.  If they are killed in this form, they return to their true self, prone on the ground, minus whatever damage they took, but can act normally.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Final Chamber - Heart of Darkness</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>The center of the sibling’s grief. A blackened stone room where the shadow horror resides.</li>
      <li><strong>Enemies</strong>: Shadow Horror (use the <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16971-oni" target="_blank">Oni</a> stat-block), 2 <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17131-shadow-demon" target="_blank">Shadow Demons</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>Encounter</strong>: The sibling is there, having been transformed into a shadowy horror, a manifestation of their grief and desire for revenge turned into a dark entity. There is an opportunity for the DM to get creative here in how they want to end this, it should match whatever common theme is used in the campaign.  For example, upon being defeated the soul of the sibling rises and is confronted by the souls of their lost family who look at them with disappointment and grief as the siblings soul is dragged away to the Shadowfell by shadowy creatures.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>That’s it, with a bit of tweaking this is a simple adventure a DM could drop into almost any campaign.  Personally, I enjoy themed adventures that are a bit different and have a narrative undertone.  I hope you might find this useful as well.</p>

<p>Now get out there and run some great games.</p>]]></content><author><name>Scott Turnbull</name></author><category term="Encounters" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Explore a dynamic Dungeons and Dragons dungeon inspired by player choices, where a warlock seeks retribution for their fallen kin.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://www.optionalrule.com/assets/img/dungon-entrance_480x600.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://www.optionalrule.com/assets/img/dungon-entrance_480x600.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Narrative Landscapes - More Engaging TTRPG Travel</title><link href="https://www.optionalrule.com/2023/07/23/painting-geography-with-narrative/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Narrative Landscapes - More Engaging TTRPG Travel" /><published>2023-07-23T12:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-07-23T12:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://www.optionalrule.com/2023/07/23/painting-geography-with-narrative</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.optionalrule.com/2023/07/23/painting-geography-with-narrative/"><![CDATA[<p>The art of travel in Tabletop Roleplaying Games remains a perennial favorite in community discussions. Despite my earlier posts on constructing <a href="/2021/07/13/perilous-journeys-in-5e-p1/">Perilous Journeys in D&amp;D 5e</a>, the conversation must go beyond mere obstacles and challenges. The true crux lies in the marriage of narrative and geography - a fusion that is underscored yet often lacks actionable guidance. So, how can we elevate the routine task of terrain description into a thrilling spark for player immersion? Let’s dive in.</p>

<p>Traditional narrative often falls into one of two traps: outlining the minutiae of geography or focusing heavily on terrain-oriented challenges. But both miss out on an essential element: potential adventure and side quests within the landscape. This bridge is exactly what we aim to build today.</p>
<figure class="figure float-end ms-4 clearfix p-3 mb-3">
    
    <img class="img-fluid figure-img " src="/assets/img/narrative-terrain_480x679.png" alt="A winding road through hills, headed towards mountains. Ruins and freshly cut logs by the roadside." height="679" width="480" />
    
    
</figure>
<h2 id="landscape-as-a-gateway-to-adventure">Landscape as a Gateway to Adventure</h2>

<p>When narrating geography, it’s not just about describing the environment. The landscape is an entity in itself, teeming with tales of bygone eras, potential adventures, and hidden secrets. Incorporating these elements into your narrative can make your players’ journey far more compelling.</p>

<p>Let’s say your adventurers are heading to Phandalin. Instead of describing it as a simple pathway towards the mountains, through increasingly steep hills, we can breathe life into this journey. Imagine instead: “You follow a narrow yet well-trodden road, winding its way towards distant, hulking mountains, snaking through gentle, tree-speckled hills. Although the roadway seems relatively young, deep-set ruts hint at heavy carts traversing this route with surprising frequency. Fortified rest stops pepper the roadside, silent sentinels in the wild, several bearing the brutal scars of past attacks.”</p>

<p>Similarly, as your adventurers approach the Sword Mountains, don’t limit the description to facts. Try this: “The landscape transforms dramatically as towering, jagged peaks capped with virgin snow thrust upwards from the lush, chaotic hills below. A testament to a turbulent history, abandoned fortresses dot the mountainsides, while evidence of beast lairs and old encampments sprawl across their ancient ruins.”</p>

<h2 id="implied-encounters-and-more">Implied Encounters and More</h2>

<p>Beyond the allure of detailed descriptions, these narratives hint at potential encounters that might lie ahead. They stoke curiosity, enticing players to delve deeper, exploring the whispers of hidden treasures or mysteries tucked away within the folds of the world.</p>

<p>The heavy usage of the roadway to Phandalin implies significant commerce, but why are these rest stops fortified, and who or what attacked them? Those abandoned fortresses in the Sword Mountains – who built them, and why were they deserted? What kinds of creatures might inhabit these mountains now? Builing off of this concept, there are any number of ways a thoughtful GM might be able to incorporate suggestive descriptions into their terrain.</p>

<p>Think about what a passing game trail that looks like a large creature barreled down it recently, was that creature chasing something or running from something?  What about thin trails of smoke suggesting small camps in the miles of wilderness surrounding the players?  Birds stirred up in the woods by something or absent altogether, a patch of landscape burned in the shape of a fan of flames or deep claw marks in a landing spot, fetishes hanging in the trees marking some territory or the remains of unfortunate travelers who might shared the parties fate?  These are all great ways to imply a story to be had in the area, build tension or suggest help, and give players more to think about between encounters.</p>

<p>By leaving these narrative hooks, you provide the players with a world that reacts and evolves around them. They may decide to investigate the fortified rest stops or seek out help from local tribes to explore those abandoned fortresses. Your players are no longer simply crossing a landscape – they’re interacting with it, making decisions based on the environment and context you’ve provided.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Geography in TTRPGs is not merely a backdrop or obstacle course but a world ripe with potential adventures. Shifting our narrative focus from straightforward descriptions to providing context and implied adventures allows players to experience the landscape in a much more immersive and dynamic way. The key lies in treating the geography as an integral part of your world’s history and its future – a character in its own right with secrets to reveal, battles to recount, and adventures to offer. Your landscapes are not just set pieces; they’re a canvas for countless stories waiting to unfold.</p>]]></content><author><name>Scott Turnbull</name></author><category term="RPG Resources" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Enhance your TTRPGs with immersive, narrative-driven travel.

If you’re intrigued by the idea of a “pet” class in D&amp;D, your primary option is to become a Necromancer and use Animate Dead. However, the image of a group of shambling undead isn’t always what players envision. Given the rich narrative tradition of casters animating objects, constructs, or elements, it’s perplexing that these options aren’t more prevalent in the game.</p>

<p>To address this conundrum, I’ve incorporated three new spells into my games. They maintain balance with Animate Dead, offer compelling options for casters, and inject an element of arcane flavor into the gameplay. Allow me to share these additions with you.</p>

<blockquote class="stat-block">
  <h4 id="animated-weapon">Animated Weapon</h4>
  <p><em>3rd-level Transmutation</em></p>

  <hr />

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 minute</li>
    <li><strong>Attack/Save:</strong> None</li>
    <li><strong>Range:</strong> 10 ft</li>
    <li><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (A target one-handed melee weapon)</li>
    <li><strong>Duration:</strong>  24 hours</li>
  </ul>

  <hr />

  <p>This spell imbues a mundane, one-handed melee weapon with potent magical energy, bringing it to life as an animated weapon. The weapon’s statistics and abilities are based on the Flying Sword as described in the Monster Manual, with the following exceptions: The damage and damage type of the animated weapon are determined by the mundane weapon type on which the spell is cast. Additionally, the caster may add their main casting ability modifier to the damage, and the weapon attacks using the caster’s melee spell attack bonus.</p>

  <p>Once the spell is cast, the animated weapon becomes sentient and recognizes you as its master. It will dutifully follow your commands and fight on your behalf. As a bonus action on your turn, you can mentally command the weapon to move and attack a target within its reach. The weapon will continue attacking that target until it is defeated, it is given a new command, or your concentration on the spell ends. If the weapon’s hit points are reduced to 0, it is destroyed, and the spell ends.</p>

  <p>The animated weapon remains under your control for the duration of the spell, but it requires your concentration while being commanded. If your concentration is broken, the weapon falls to the ground and becomes an ordinary inanimate weapon until you regain concentration to command it once more.</p>

  <p>At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by one weapon die for every two slot levels above 3rd.</p>

<blockquote class="stat-block">
  <h4 id="clockwork-servant">Clockwork Servant</h4>
  <p><em>3rd-level Conjuration</em></p>

  <hr />

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 minute</li>
    <li><strong>Attack/Save:</strong> None</li>
    <li><strong>Range:</strong> 10 ft</li>
    <li><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (10 gp scrap metal and parts)</li>
    <li><strong>Duration:</strong>  24 hours</li>
  </ul>

  <hr />

  <p>This spell creates a loyal clockwork servant, imbuing a significant source of scrap metal. The servant takes on the form and aesthetics determined by the caster’s wishes, while inheriting the abilities and characteristics of a Modron. Consult with the game master for the specific statistics of the construct servant.</p>

  <p>On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to mentally command any clockwork servant created by this spell, as long as it is within 60 feet of you. If you control multiple servants, you can command any or all of them simultaneously, issuing the same command to each one. You decide the construct’s actions and movement for its next turn, or you can give a general command, such as guarding a specific area. In the absence of specific commands, the construct defends itself against hostile creatures. Once a command is given, the servant continues to follow it until its task is complete.</p>

  <p>The construct servant remains under your control for 24 hours. After this duration, it degrades into component parts. To maintain control of a construct servant for an additional 24 hours, you must cast this spell on it again before the current 24-hour period ends. When you do so, you can reassert your control over up to four servants you have created with this spell, instead of creating new ones.</p>

  <p>If the spell expires, or when destroyed, a caster may recover 1d10 gp worth of material from the remnants of a servant.</p>

  <p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can create or reassert control over two additional construct servants for each slot level above 3rd.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="stat-block">
  <h4 id="elemental-servant">Elemental Servant</h4>
  <p><em>3rd-level Evocation</em></p>

  <hr />

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Casting Time:</strong> 1 minute</li>
    <li><strong>Attack/Save:</strong> None</li>
    <li><strong>Range:</strong> 10 ft</li>
    <li><strong>Components:</strong> V, S, M (source element of creature)</li>
    <li><strong>Duration:</strong>  24 hours</li>
  </ul>

  <hr />

  <p>This spell creates a loyal elemental servant, imbuing a significant source of earth, fire, air, or water within range with arcane animus and the semblance of life. The servant takes the form of a Mud, Steam, or Smoke Mephit, determined by the element used during the casting of the spell. Refer to the game master for the creature’s statistics.</p>

  <p>On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to mentally command any servant created by this spell as long as it is within 60 feet of you. If you control multiple servants, you can command any or all of them simultaneously, issuing the same command to each one. You decide the creature’s actions and movement for its next turn, or you can give a general command, such as guarding a specific chamber or corridor. In the absence of specific commands, the creature defends itself against hostile creatures. Once a command is given, the servant continues to follow it until its task is complete.</p>

  <p>The servant remains under your control for 24 hours. After this duration, it no longer obeys your commands. To maintain control of a servant for an additional 24 hours, you must cast this spell on it again before the current 24-hour period ends. When you do so, you can reassert your control over up to four creatures you have animated with this spell, rather than creating new ones.</p>

  <p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can animate or reassert control over two additional creatures for each slot level above 3rd.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="integration-and-discovery">Integration and Discovery:</h2>
<p>To amplify the sense of adventure and discovery, I weave these spells into the fabric of the narrative instead of presenting them as standard spells accessible to all. I create opportunities for players to uncover these spells through their in-game actions. They might discover them as forgotten wisdom within a concealed library, earn them as accolades for gaining admission into a renowned wizard’s guild, or retrieve them from the ancient scrolls nestled in a formidable dragon’s treasure trove. By tying the procurement of these spells to the storyline, I instill an extra layer of intrigue and thrill, enriching my players’ journey. I think you can too.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>These spells open some fun possibilities for arcane spellcasters, providing players the opportunity to control flavorful arcane servants. With a sprinkle of creativity, you could even extend these spells to encompass additional schools of magic. Remember to find fun ways to weave these into your campaign, making them a rewarding part of the adventure. If concerns about power creep arise, you can always introduce a material component cost or other means to regulate the spell’s use within the world. Ultimately, I believe players seeking this type of interaction will find these spells tremendously enjoyable.</p>

In particular, how the system seems disconnected from the gameplay and action. It can seem counter-intuitive when zero hit points result in the same outcome for any character, regardless of how they arrived there. The Death Save min-game is the same, whether you’ve taken a single point of damage, or sustained a catastrophic 150-foot fall. In this post, I aim to dissect the effects of this system on the game and propose a house rule that could shake things up to make the prospect of death an exciting part of the action again.</p>

<figure class="figure float-end ms-4 clearfix p-3 mb-5">
    
    <img class="img-fluid figure-img " src="/assets/img/wounded_character_480x720.jpg" alt="A wounded warrior crawling on the ground with an arrow sticking out of their side." height="720" width="480" />
    
    
</figure>

<h2 id="death-saves-in-action">Death Saves in Action</h2>

<p>Under the standard 5e DnD rules, when you hit 0 HP you start rolling an unmodified D20 (in most cases) once you hit 0 HP, with a 10 or higher marking a success and a 9 or lower signifying a failure. The odds are slightly in favor of success (55%) than failure (45%) on each roll. After you accumulate three of either outcome, your fate is sealed. So you have a 60% chance of survival, with 18% of those possibly regaining consciousness at 1 HP. Most of these rolls resolve themselves within four turns, although Healing Word makes most of that irrelevant anyway.</p>

<p>While this system allows for players to quickly rejoin the action, it doesn’t necessarily add to the excitement of the encounter if reaching 0 HP doesn’t carry much risk. In fact, the urgency for other players to save you diminishes as you’re not under immediate threat. In fact, I would suggest that this was so devoid of tension that Healing Word was designed the way it was just so you didn’t have to interact much with the system. To me, this illustrates how rules can cascade across the system, reducing tension and lessening the importance of team interdependence.</p>

<h2 id="house-rule-positive-experiences-through-negative-hit-points">House Rule: Positive Experiences through Negative Hit Points</h2>

<p>I used a House Rule in my 3E days that I think could easily be adapted in 5E. This rule ties the risk of death more closely to the level of action, buts more managed uncertainty back into an encounter, and encourages collective responsibility for the group’s survival.</p>

<p>A character can drop negative HP up to their Constitution (CON) score plus level, before they succumb to death. When a character’s HP drop below 0 and they haven’t yet stabilized, they need to make a CON save. The difficulty class (DC) for this save is equal to their current negative hit point total. Failure results in the character’s demise, while a successful save inflicts 1 point of damage. Achieving success on two saves stabilizes the character at their present negative HP value.</p>

<p>Any healing received that doesn’t elevate the character to 0 HP or above, counts as a single successful save towards stabilization.</p>

<p>Characters with a negative HP value up to their CON modifier must remain prone and are unable to take bonus actions or reactions until their hit points return  above 0.</p>

<p><em>DMs may want to consider removing the Healing Word spell from the game or reducing it to just 1d4 of healing, otherwise this is needless complexity without changing things much.</em></p>

<h2 id="effect-on-play">Effect on Play</h2>

<p>Does this house rule make the game more “realistic?” Not necessarily. HP in DnD isn’t designed to mimic reality. Instead, it sets the tone of the game. Under this rule, stabilization could be achieved after a few successful rolls - relatively simple at -1 HP, but quite challenging at -15 HP.</p>

<p>This rule adds a sense of urgency and heightened risk to the game play. The deeper into the negatives you go, the harder it is for you to recover. Healing now has a significant effect, and the scale of the healing can make a significant difference.  Even Healing Word is helpful, but not as over powered as many lament.</p>

<p>The heightened stakes inspire more caution as characters become more wounded and make players more invested in their downed teammates’ outcomes. Ultimately, this gives players more reasons to interact, and damage becomes more than a countdown to zero HP.</p>

<p>In other words, downing a hero is back to being a significant event in combat, as it should be.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>While the 5e Death Save system serves its purpose, its disconnect from the action in an encounter and lack of urgency can leave some players wanting more. By revisiting an older house rule, I think we can add back some tension, interactivity, and adjust the tone of encounters so they feel like something is at stake again.</p>

<p>In the end, it’s about the feel of your game. Does the standard Death Save system work for your group, or could you benefit from tweaking the rules to spice things up?

While they may seem simple on the surface, these fundamental aspects of D&amp;D often engender misunderstandings and heated debates. Armor Class, though instinctively viewed as a gauge of whether a character is struck or not, is in fact a more abstract concept. Following my recent post <a href="/2023/06/02/what-are-hit-points-in-dnd/">What are HPs in D&amp;D anyway?</a>, it’s fitting that we now unpack the intricacies of AC and its symbiotic relationship with HP - the two crucial pillars that underpin the game’s combat system.</p>

<h2 id="the-genesis-of-armor-class">The Genesis of Armor Class</h2>

<p>The genesis of AC in D&amp;D dates back to the game’s wargaming origins, where combat was typically a binary concept - either a unit was victorious or it was defeated. But as D&amp;D emerged, focusing on individual combat encounters instead of unit battles, a more intricate system was called for. To build and sustain tension for individual characters throughout an adventure, a ‘tug of war’ mechanic was introduced, wherein the game sought to quantify both a character’s resilience HP and the time needed to overcome them. Hence, Armor Class was born.</p>

<p>In Original D&amp;D (OD&amp;D), AC represented the challenge of landing a damaging hit on your character. However, it left the concept of a ‘hit’ undefined. Was it a sword deflecting off plate armor? A deft evasion? A streak of divine luck? The rulebook intentionally remained silent on these specifics, emphasizing AC’s inherent abstraction.</p>

<p>It’s important to appreciate that the architects of D&amp;D were well aware of the ‘swinginess’ of D20s. They understood that setting up a damage over time mechanic, regulated by the frequency of hits and the strength of attacks, was the most effective way to offset this inherent randomness. This allowed Adventures to be risky, but not random. An incredibly important element of TTRPG game design, if you wanted players to invest in their characters.</p>

<h2 id="armor-class-defining-its-abstraction">Armor Class: Defining its Abstraction</h2>

<p>As the D&amp;D editions evolved, the ambiguity of AC continued. Some players interpreted it as purely physical protection - the better the armor, the higher the AC. But armor could be bulky and restrictive. How would that account for the nimbleness of an unarmored monk? Or the ability of a rogue to evade attacks? Here’s where the abstraction comes into play.</p>

<p>AC is not just about physical armor. It encapsulates all the factors that might prevent a character from taking damage - natural agility, training, magical protection, divine favor, sheer luck, and yes, wearing a sturdy suit of armor. But, like HP, it’s not literally any of these things. It’s a mechanical tool that enables players to visualize their characters surviving in a dangerous world.</p>

<h2 id="the-dance-of-ac-and-hp">The Dance of AC and HP</h2>

<p>The relationship between AC and HP forms the basis of the D&amp;D Damage Over Time system. A character’s AC determines how likely they are to evade damage, while HP defines how much damage they can withstand before being defeated.</p>

<p>To illustrate, imagine a heavily armored knight (high AC, high HP) and a lightly armored rogue (lower AC, lower HP). The knight, with their superior armor, can absorb more hits before their HP depletes. In contrast, the rogue relies on their agility to avoid hits, mitigating the need for a large HP pool. Neither is invincible - the knight might face a foe with an accurate strike, and the rogue could encounter an enemy with an area attack that’s hard to dodge.</p>

<p>However, it’s vital to understand that AC isn’t a literal damage reduction. A higher AC doesn’t directly decrease the damage you take - but higher AC does mean you’ll take less damage over time. In this way, the single simple AC value serves the narrative role of damage reduction, as miss, or just toughing it out. Similarly, a high HP doesn’t mean you can shrug off a dragon’s fire breath - it represents your ability to avoid the worst of the attack, keep going despite the pain, or recover quickly.</p>

<h2 id="unshackling-the-abstraction">Unshackling the Abstraction</h2>

<p>It’s worth repeating that both AC and HP are mechanical tools for the game, not narrative shackles. They offer a game-friendly way to handle the complex, chaotic nature of combat without bogging down in ultra-realism that could hinder gameplay.</p>

<p>As the DM, it’s your job to help the mechanics flow into the narrative to best fit your campaign’s tone. You could describe the dodges and near misses for a rogue with high AC, or the punishing blows that a knight absorbs through heavy armor and sheer toughness. In other words, the mechanics tension and provides momentum to a scene without getting in the way of the narrative tone of the game.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion-embrace-the-abstract">Conclusion: Embrace the Abstract</h2>

<p>Attempting to pin down AC in literal terms is a pure madness. Much like HPs, AC is best understood as an abstraction. Representative of various factors contributing to your character’s survivability in combat. It’s not simply the quality of a character’s armor, nor their ability to dodge, but a mix of physical, skillful, and even supernatural factors. It’s all of it, or none of it depending on how it fits the tone of your game.</p>

<p>Rules play a pivotal role in defining the tone, pace, and action in a TTRPG. At some point, most D&amp;D fans question the abstract nature of AC and HP, wondering why armor doesn’t directly mitigate damage. While damage reduction systems can be enjoyable, D&amp;D offers two broad alternatives: reduce damage per hit or leverage AC to apply damage less frequently. Both approaches yield similar outcomes, but AC achieves this without adding further mathematical steps, underlining its design simplicity.</p>

<p>And so, dear reader, as with Hit Points, I encourage you to embrace the abstract nature of Armor Class. It’s a tool, a game mechanic designed to simulate the unpredictability and risk of combat in a fantasy world. It’s there help build a narrative through game play, because you don’t need a lesson in impact physics, you need a trilling duel in the streets of Neverwinter!  Use it as such, and weave it into your narrative in a way that enhances your game, not restricts it. Happy gaming!</p>]]></content><author><name>Scott Turnbull</name></author><category term="Analysis" /><category term="RPG Resources" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Explore the abstraction of Armor Class in D&D, its roots in wargaming, and its dance with Hit Points.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://www.optionalrule.com/assets/img/the_duel_480x720.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://www.optionalrule.com/assets/img/the_duel_480x720.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry></feed>
