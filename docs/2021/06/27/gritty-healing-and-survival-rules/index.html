            <p>The heroic playstyle of 5e D&amp;D is a lot of fun, but it is overly focused on the encounter. Sometimes players want to break things up with more of a gritty or survivalist style. This means adding gameplay elements that focus on attrition, strategic resource management, prevention, and lean into the fragile nature of health. In other words, it extends gameplay into longer term campaign elements, rather than containing it to individual encounters. As a result of Matt Colvilles video on the topic this week, I was inspired to write down my own thoughts on gritty rules for 5e.</p>

<p><strong><em>Important Side Note:</em></strong> Gritty play is sometimes pushed with a sense of elitism. This is a silly position and it is just a style of play. Keep that in mind. If you choose this style of play, the game is inherently going to get much more about tracking and managing resources. There is nothing wrong if that style of play is for you. However, if enjoy that style, these rules should give you something to sink your teeth into.</p>

<h2 id="dont-we-have-this-already">Don’t We Have This Already?</h2>
<p>Discussion of gritty mechanics and survival rules in 5e is an evergreen topic. A quick google search will turn up a number grim dark, gritty, or other survival rules. However, I never thought these hit the right spot of the right focus or right level of depth for my own campaigns. Even the 5e DMG has a set of Gritty Realism rules to use that just extends short rests to once a day, and long-rests to once a week. Rather than providing a different style of play, the gritty realism rules just make everything take longer. Therefore, they are neither gritty nor realistic. Instead, these are an expansion of the Slow Natural Healing rules in Chapter 9 of the DMG.</p>

<p><strong>A Quick Note on Realism:</strong> A frequent mistake people make is to assume this is an attempt to make 5e more realistic or simulationist.  It is not.  Instead, this is just a shift of the focus of gameplay from the encounter to more long-term elements.</p>

<p>Where noted these house rules replace the standard 5e rules.</p>

<h3 id="healing">Healing</h3>
<p>Short and Long rest healing is no longer used, otherwise rests work as normal.  Meaning, players may only spend their Hit Dice (HD) to heal at the end of a Long Rest. Also, HD are spent separately to heal ability scores, drain, and damage. Additionally players roll to recover spent Hit Die.  In this way, injuries in a single combat is not as taxing as prolonged combats and injuries.</p>

<p>The sequence is as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Recovery Spent HD</li>
  <li>Choose to spend HD on healing ability damage, drain, or to recovery hit points.</li>
  <li>Modify any HD roll by the recovery conditions.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="recovering-spent-hd">Recovering Spent HD</h4>
<p>Hit Dice are recovered by rolling a DC 13 Constitution for each spent HD at the end of a long rest, before any healing. Disadvantage may be imposed under harsh conditions or if unable to rest, likewise advantage may be granted under good recovery conditions and medical care.</p>

<h4 id="spending-hd-on-recovery">Spending HD on Recovery</h4>
<p>Players choose to spend their HD to heal ability loss, drain, or damage seperatly as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>One point of ability score loss.</li>
  <li>One Hit Die roll to recovery drain.</li>
  <li>One Hit Die roll to heal damage up to their max hit points.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="modifying-hit-die-rolls">Modifying Hit Die Rolls</h4>
<p>Recovery assumes you have access to good shelter, food, sleep, and care.  For each one of these conditions not met, the Hit Die rolled for recovery is reduced by one type.  This means 1d12 becomes 1d10, 1d10 a 1d8, and so forth down to a minimum of 1 point. See Chapter 5 in the DMG for more on conditions and survival.</p>

<p><strong>Shelter:</strong> This assumes a restful and clean environment such as a private inn room or residence.  In the wilderness this requires a DC 10 Wisdom (Survival) check with adequate supplies like tents, or a DC 15 check to setup a camp from scratch. Poor conditions or resource may impose disadvantage.</p>

<p><strong>Good Food:</strong> A hot meal or good quality food is needed for healing. Characters can use the <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/adventure-environments#Foraging">Foraging Rules</a> from Chapter 5 of the DMG if they need to find food in the wilderness.</p>

<p><strong>Sleep</strong>: Sleep or meditation is required as normal for your face.  Without adequate shelter or if interrupted with combat this may require an individual DC 15 Constitution (Survival) check to satisfy this requirement.</p>

<p><strong>Medical Care:</strong> Having proper care is important to heal properly. Characters proficient in the Medicine skill may make a DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check to provide proper medical care to themselves or others.  The DC is increased by 2 for every patient over the first and is made at disadvantage without proper medical supplies.  This check may be made at advantage by expending a use of a Healing Kit.</p>

<h2 id="other-considerations">Other Considerations</h2>

<p>All-in-all a gritty playstyle will have extended rules over a number of sub-systems.  These can be as expansive or brief as fits your campaign. However, I recommend starting with these gritty healing rules and see how they land with your players and expanding from there if it seems fun.  If you find this fun, you may also want to consider other expanded rules or modifications.</p>

<p><strong>Limiting Hit Points:</strong> 5e does a better job of doing damage than most people give it credit for. However, there are various OSR rules for hit points you may want to consider if this is right for  you.</p>

<p><strong>Lowering Ability Scores:</strong> Many gritty games lean into randomly generated ability scores rather than having everyone in the group easily reaching maximum humanoid potential.  So, choose a generation method that is right for you. Additionally, you may want to consider doing away with Ability Score Increases (ASI) and using Feats as the only option. This can add more variety and customization and some still come with a +1 ASI.</p>

<p><strong>Spells:</strong> Gritty plan puts more burden on spells and spellcasters.  Some DMs may consider banning or modifying spells like Goodberry, Create Water, and Healing Spirit.</p>

<h2 id="campaigns">Campaigns</h2>
<p>Introducing a system like this significantly impacts the pacing of campaigns and challenge of encounters.  This system works better for campaigns with modular encounters and opportunities to manage rest and recovery.  Therefore, campaigns like Lost Mines of Phandelver, or Rime of the Frostmaiden may be better suited.  Campaigns like Out of the Abyss or Tomb of Annihilation may require a lot of modification by the DM or be a poor fit for this style of play.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Gritty rules aren’t for everyone but can be a fun variation on your 5e play or better suited for some groups playstyles. To be successful, you need full buy in from everyone in the group and have to enjoy the management and level of detail that goes into this kind of play.  Those that enjoy it can welcome the challenge of planning through how to set themselves up for recovery or mitigating for loss. DMs would do well to provide players both opportunities to shine, and interesting challenges to overcome through planning and preparation.</p>
