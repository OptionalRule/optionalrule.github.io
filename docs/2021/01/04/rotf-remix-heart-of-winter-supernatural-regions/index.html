            <p>With the publication of Tasha’s Caldron of Everything, the game introduced the concepts of Supernatural Regions to 5th edition Dungeons and Dragons. Areas that have variable and mysterious effects that might be invoked by specific actions or conditions. Within Icewind Dale are localized arcane phenomenon zones said to manifest The Heart of Winter, that is the conjunction of planar regions brought into alignment with Icewind Dale as a function of Auril’s ongoing enchantments. Small clusters of these supernatural phenomenon ebb and flow across the region and it has been growing in frequency, intensity, and size as time progresses.</p>

<p>Arcane scholars suspect casting of spells such as Control Weather, Magnificent Mansion, or similar spells may cause one of these regions to manifest.</p>

<p>Consider rolling on the Heart of Winter Magical Effects table when the following circumstances occur in one of these regions.</p>

<ul>
  <li>After spending more than an hour resting.</li>
  <li>A creature is brought to zero hit points.</li>
  <li>A spell is cast that does Thunder, Cold, or Fire damage.</li>
  <li>An open flame is produced naturally or by a spell.</li>
  <li>A creature is Paralyzed</li>
