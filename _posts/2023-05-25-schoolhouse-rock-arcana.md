Sure, here are some spells inspired by the educational animated series School House Rock. Please note that these are homebrew spells and may need adjustment for balance purposes. 

**1. Conjunction Junction**
*School: Enchantment (Bard, Wizard)*
*Level: 2*
*Casting time: 1 action*
*Range: 30 feet*
*Components: V, S, M (a small piece of train track)*
*Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute*

You use your arcane abilities to hook up Heroes, and Allies, and Friends. You enchant your allies, connecting and allowing them to work together. Up to three creatures you choose within range can use their reaction to move up to their speed when an ally within 30 feet of them makes an attack.

**I'm Just a Bill**

*School: Enchantment*
*Level: 4*
*Casting Time: 1 minute*
*Range: Touch*
*Components: V, S, M (a piece of parchment, a quill and ink worth at least 50 gp, which the spell consumes)*
*Duration: Until dispelled or fulfilled*

You write a bill on a piece of parchment which includes up to three commands for action. The commands must be written in a language the intended reader understands. As part of casting the spell, you must touch the parchment, which imbues the bill with a compelling aura.

When a creature reads the bill, it must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it believes the bill is an absolute law that it must obey to the best of its ability. The creature will try to fulfill the commands to the letter and interpret them in the most straightforward way. If the commands are harmful or contrary to the creature's fundamental nature, it gets advantage on the saving throw.

The commands can continue to be fulfilled over the course of days, if the bill's instructions can't be completed in a single action or short period. The spell ends when the commands are completed or if they become impossible to fulfill. 

If the commands involve interactions with other creatures, those creatures can make a Wisdom (Insight) check against your spell save DC to discern the bill is magically compelled. 

This spell has no effect on creatures with an Intelligence of 2 or lower or those that can't understand the language of the bill. 

**Interjection**

*School: Enchantment*
*Level: 2*
*Casting Time: 1 action*
*Range: 60 feet*
*Components: V, S*
*Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute*

When you cast this spell, choose a target creature you can see within range and select one of the following interjections: "Huzzah!", "Aha!", or "Oh no!". The interjection you choose infuses the target with a magical effect related to its meaning. 

* "Huzzah!" fills the target with courage. For the duration, the target has advantage on all saving throws against being frightened and gains a +1 bonus to attack rolls and saving throws.
* "Aha!" sharpens the target's perception. For the duration, the target has advantage on all Wisdom (Perception) and Intelligence (Investigation) checks.
* "Oh no!" imposes a sense of impending doom. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for the duration. A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear (you) is within line of sight, and the creature can't willingly move closer to the source of its fear.

At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each level above 2nd. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.
