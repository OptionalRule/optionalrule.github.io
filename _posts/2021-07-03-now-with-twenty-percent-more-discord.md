summary: I've put up a discord server for rpg and 5e rules discussion, advice for games, and other TTRPG Talk.
---

I just opened a discord server for rules discussions, workshops and the like.  People interested in thoughtful 
discussions on 5e or TTRPG rules, adventures or more are welcome to sign up. Please note that general rules of 
good social interactions and good-faith conversations apply. This will likely be a small server but anyone is 
welcome who wants to get into a deeper conversation than Twitter allows. Please feel free to share this link. 
The server just opened this weekend and is still getting set-up.

If you're seeing this announcement at a later date just hit me up on Twitter for an invite link.
