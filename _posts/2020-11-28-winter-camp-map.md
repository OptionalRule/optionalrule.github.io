I created this map for a camp based random encounter from my Rime of the Frostmaiden campaign using <a href="https://dungeondraft.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DungeonDraft</a>.  It's a standard 25x25 battlemap with five feet distance per 100 px. I hope you'll get some use out of this for your game too.
