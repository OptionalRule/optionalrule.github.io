description: Explore new servant summoning spells for DnD 5e! This post introduces three innovative spells, adding depth and fun to your arcane gameplay.
---
As a fan of magically animated minions, I've always felt somewhat limited by the options available in the 5th edition of Dungeons and Dragons. If you're intrigued by the idea of a "pet" class in D&D, your primary option is to become a Necromancer and use Animate Dead. However, the image of a group of shambling undead isn't always what players envision. Given the rich narrative tradition of casters animating objects, constructs, or elements, it's perplexing that these options aren't more prevalent in the game.

To address this conundrum, I've incorporated three new spells into my games. They maintain balance with Animate Dead, offer compelling options for casters, and inject an element of arcane flavor into the gameplay. Allow me to share these additions with you.

> #### Animated Weapon
> *3rd-level Transmutation*
> 
> ___
> 
> - **Casting Time:** 1 minute
> - **Attack/Save:** None
> - **Range:** 10 ft
> - **Components:** V, S, M (A target one-handed melee weapon)
> - **Duration:**  24 hours
> 
> ___
>
> This spell imbues a mundane, one-handed melee weapon with potent magical energy, bringing it to life as an animated weapon. The weapon's statistics and abilities are based on the Flying Sword as described in the Monster Manual, with the following exceptions: The damage and damage type of the animated weapon are determined by the mundane weapon type on which the spell is cast. Additionally, the caster may add their main casting ability modifier to the damage, and the weapon attacks using the caster's melee spell attack bonus.
>
> Once the spell is cast, the animated weapon becomes sentient and recognizes you as its master. It will dutifully follow your commands and fight on your behalf. As a bonus action on your turn, you can mentally command the weapon to move and attack a target within its reach. The weapon will continue attacking that target until it is defeated, it is given a new command, or your concentration on the spell ends. If the weapon's hit points are reduced to 0, it is destroyed, and the spell ends.
>
> The animated weapon remains under your control for the duration of the spell, but it requires your concentration while being commanded. If your concentration is broken, the weapon falls to the ground and becomes an ordinary inanimate weapon until you regain concentration to command it once more.
>
> At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by one weapon die for every two slot levels above 3rd.

> #### Clockwork Servant
> *3rd-level Conjuration*
> 
> ___
> 
> - **Casting Time:** 1 minute
> - **Attack/Save:** None
> - **Range:** 10 ft
> - **Components:** V, S, M (10 gp scrap metal and parts)
> - **Duration:**  24 hours
> 
> ___
>
> This spell creates a loyal clockwork servant, imbuing a significant source of scrap metal. The servant takes on the form and aesthetics determined by the caster's wishes, while inheriting the abilities and characteristics of a Modron. Consult with the game master for the specific statistics of the construct servant.
>
> On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to mentally command any clockwork servant created by this spell, as long as it is within 60 feet of you. If you control multiple servants, you can command any or all of them simultaneously, issuing the same command to each one. You decide the construct's actions and movement for its next turn, or you can give a general command, such as guarding a specific area. In the absence of specific commands, the construct defends itself against hostile creatures. Once a command is given, the servant continues to follow it until its task is complete.
>
> The construct servant remains under your control for 24 hours. After this duration, it degrades into component parts. To maintain control of a construct servant for an additional 24 hours, you must cast this spell on it again before the current 24-hour period ends. When you do so, you can reassert your control over up to four servants you have created with this spell, instead of creating new ones.
>
> If the spell expires, or when destroyed, a caster may recover 1d10 gp worth of material from the remnants of a servant.
>
> **At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can create or reassert control over two additional construct servants for each slot level above 3rd.

> #### Elemental Servant
> *3rd-level Evocation*
> 
> ___
> 
> - **Casting Time:** 1 minute
> - **Attack/Save:** None
> - **Range:** 10 ft
> - **Components:** V, S, M (source element of creature)
> - **Duration:**  24 hours
>
> ___
>
> This spell creates a loyal elemental servant, imbuing a significant source of earth, fire, air, or water within range with arcane animus and the semblance of life. The servant takes the form of a Mud, Steam, or Smoke Mephit, determined by the element used during the casting of the spell. Refer to the game master for the creature's statistics.
>
> On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to mentally command any servant created by this spell as long as it is within 60 feet of you. If you control multiple servants, you can command any or all of them simultaneously, issuing the same command to each one. You decide the creature's actions and movement for its next turn, or you can give a general command, such as guarding a specific chamber or corridor. In the absence of specific commands, the creature defends itself against hostile creatures. Once a command is given, the servant continues to follow it until its task is complete.
>
> The servant remains under your control for 24 hours. After this duration, it no longer obeys your commands. To maintain control of a servant for an additional 24 hours, you must cast this spell on it again before the current 24-hour period ends. When you do so, you can reassert your control over up to four creatures you have animated with this spell, rather than creating new ones.
>
> **At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can animate or reassert control over two additional creatures for each slot level above 3rd.

## Integration and Discovery:
To amplify the sense of adventure and discovery, I weave these spells into the fabric of the narrative instead of presenting them as standard spells accessible to all. I create opportunities for players to uncover these spells through their in-game actions. They might discover them as forgotten wisdom within a concealed library, earn them as accolades for gaining admission into a renowned wizard's guild, or retrieve them from the ancient scrolls nestled in a formidable dragon's treasure trove. By tying the procurement of these spells to the storyline, I instill an extra layer of intrigue and thrill, enriching my players' journey. I think you can too.

## Conclusion
These spells open some fun possibilities for arcane spellcasters, providing players the opportunity to control flavorful arcane servants. With a sprinkle of creativity, you could even extend these spells to encompass additional schools of magic. Remember to find fun ways to weave these into your campaign, making them a rewarding part of the adventure. If concerns about power creep arise, you can always introduce a material component cost or other means to regulate the spell's use within the world. Ultimately, I believe players seeking this type of interaction will find these spells tremendously enjoyable.

Now get out there and run some great games!
