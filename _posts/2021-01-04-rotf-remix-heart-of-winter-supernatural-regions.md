With the publication of Tasha&#8217;s Caldron of Everything, the game introduced the concepts of Supernatural Regions to 5th edition Dungeons and Dragons. Areas that have variable and mysterious effects that might be invoked by specific actions or conditions. Within Icewind Dale are localized arcane phenomenon zones said to manifest The Heart of Winter, that is the conjunction of planar regions brought into alignment with Icewind Dale as a function of Auril&#8217;s ongoing enchantments. Small clusters of these supernatural phenomenon ebb and flow across the region and it has been growing in frequency, intensity, and size as time progresses.

Arcane scholars suspect casting of spells such as Control Weather, Magnificent Mansion, or similar spells may cause one of these regions to manifest.

## Heart of Winter Magical Effects


|d100|Effect|
|--- |--- |
|1-5|All flames are extinguished, magical or natural. Any spell producing a flame effect, heat, or controls temperature fails or ends.|
|6-10|A spell cast that delivers cold damage does not use a spell slot or charge as normal. This can occur only once per person or item in a given day.|
|11-15|One of the characters in the region must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be transformed into a Yeti, as if by the polymorph spell. This last for 1 hour or until dispelled.|

|21-25|Simple or martial weapons in the region that are nonmagical radiate with intense cold. For 1 hour, they become magic weapons that grant +1d4 cold damage in addition to weapon damage.|
|26-30|Each character in the region is able to cast the Frostbite cantrip as if they were a 1st level caster if they do not already know the spell. The spell save DC is 15.|
|31-35|Any deep snow in the region acts as Quicksand for the next 10 minutes. See ‘Wilderness Hazards: Quicksand” in the DMG.|
|36-40|Any humanoid who dies in the next hour rises as a Coldlight Walker, within 2d4 minutes. See Appendix C of Rime of the Frostmaiden.|

|56-60|One random creature in the region receives terrifying visions of a dead frozen world and must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened and may reroll their saving throw once every minute. The frightened creature will drop any items it is carrying and use the dash action to run in a random direction for the duration. They may repeat the saving throw if they move into obvious danger or are damaged.|
|61-65|A dense mist permeates the region and when it clears, any creatures and objects caught in the mist find themselves teleported to a random location on top of the Reghed Glacier.|

For the next 10 minutes, every creature must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion. Anyone wearing Cold Weather gear or with resistance to cold may make the saving throw at advantage. Creatures immune to cold damage are also immune to the effects.|
