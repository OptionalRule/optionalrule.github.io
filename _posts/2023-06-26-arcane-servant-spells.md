The captivating world of Dungeons and Dragons (DnD) 5e is filled with countless spells and abilities. Among these, the Animate Dead spell has always stood out for me. It's unique because it allows the caster to turn into a quintessential pet-controlling class for an extended period. This characteristic is uncommon as the 5e version has significantly toned down summoning spells compared to its previous versions. Moreover, the creature array available to the caster has also been pared down, making the persistence of servant summoning spells a peculiar phenomenon.

What strikes me as odder still is that the surviving spell summons undead creatures. However, the idea of a long-term summoned servant, pet, or companion originating from other schools of magic seems quite balanced and straightforward. Therefore, I propose a few additional spells to broaden the possibilities of summoning and binding servants for casters.

> #### Animated Weapon
> *3rd-level Transmutation*
> 
> ___
> 
> - **Casting Time:** 1 minute
> - **Attack/Save:** None
> - **Range:** 10 ft
> - **Components:** V, S, M (A target one-handed melee weapon)
> - **Duration:**  24 hours
> 
> ___
>
> This spell imbues a mundane, one-handed melee weapon with potent magical energy, bringing it to life as an animated weapon. The weapon's statistics and abilities are based on the Flying Sword as described in the Monster Manual, with the following exceptions: The damage and damage type of the animated weapon are determined by the mundane weapon type on which the spell is cast. Additionally, the caster may add their main casting ability modifier to the damage, and the weapon attacks using the caster's melee spell attack bonus.
>
> Once the spell is cast, the animated weapon becomes sentient and recognizes you as its master. It will dutifully follow your commands and fight on your behalf. As a bonus action on your turn, you can mentally command the weapon to move and attack a target within its reach. The weapon will continue attacking that target until it is defeated, it is given a new command, or your concentration on the spell ends. If the weapon's hit points are reduced to 0, it is destroyed, and the spell ends.
>
> The animated weapon remains under your control for the duration of the spell, but it requires your concentration while being commanded. If your concentration is broken, the weapon falls to the ground and becomes an ordinary inanimate weapon until you regain concentration to command it once more.
>
> At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by one weapon die for every two slot levels above 3rd.

> #### Clockwork Servant
> *3rd-level Conjuration*
> 
> ___
> 
> - **Casting Time:** 1 minute
> - **Attack/Save:** None
> - **Range:** 10 ft
> - **Components:** V, S, M (10 gp scrap metal and parts)
> - **Duration:**  24 hours
> 
> ___
>
> This spell creates a loyal clockwork servant, imbuing a significant source of scrap metal. The servant takes on the form and aesthetics determined by the caster's wishes, while inheriting the abilities and characteristics of a Modron. Consult with the game master for the specific statistics of the construct servant.
>
> On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to mentally command any clockwork servant created by this spell, as long as it is within 60 feet of you. If you control multiple servants, you can command any or all of them simultaneously, issuing the same command to each one. You decide the construct's actions and movement for its next turn, or you can give a general command, such as guarding a specific area. In the absence of specific commands, the construct defends itself against hostile creatures. Once a command is given, the servant continues to follow it until its task is complete.
>
> The construct servant remains under your control for 24 hours. After this duration, it degrades into component parts. To maintain control of a construct servant for an additional 24 hours, you must cast this spell on it again before the current 24-hour period ends. When you do so, you can reassert your control over up to four servants you have created with this spell, instead of creating new ones.
>
> If the spell expires, or when destroyed, a caster may recover 1d10 gp worth of material from the remnants of a servant.
>
> **At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can create or reassert control over two additional construct servants for each slot level above 3rd.

> #### Elemental Servant
> *3rd-level Evocation*
> 
> ___
> 
> - **Casting Time:** 1 minute
> - **Attack/Save:** None
> - **Range:** 10 ft
> - **Components:** V, S, M (source element of creature)
> - **Duration:**  24 hours
>
> ___
>
> This spell creates a loyal elemental servant, imbuing a significant source of earth, fire, air, or water within range with arcane animus and the semblance of life. The servant takes the form of a Mud, Steam, or Smoke Mephit, determined by the element used during the casting of the spell. Refer to the game master for the creature's statistics.
>
> On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to mentally command any servant created by this spell as long as it is within 60 feet of you. If you control multiple servants, you can command any or all of them simultaneously, issuing the same command to each one. You decide the creature's actions and movement for its next turn, or you can give a general command, such as guarding a specific chamber or corridor. In the absence of specific commands, the creature defends itself against hostile creatures. Once a command is given, the servant continues to follow it until its task is complete.
>
> The servant remains under your control for 24 hours. After this duration, it no longer obeys your commands. To maintain control of a servant for an additional 24 hours, you must cast this spell on it again before the current 24-hour period ends. When you do so, you can reassert your control over up to four creatures you have animated with this spell, rather than creating new ones.
>
> **At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can animate or reassert control over two additional creatures for each slot level above 3rd.

## Integration and Discovery:
To enhance the sense of adventure and discovery, we recommend incorporating these spells into your campaign as part of the narrative. Rather than offering them as standard spells available to all, allow players to stumble upon these spells through exciting encounters. They might uncover them as lost knowledge within a hidden library, receive them as rewards for joining a prestigious wizard's guild, or even recover them from the ancient scrolls of a mighty dragon's hoard. By making the acquisition of these spells a part of the story, you can add a layer of intrigue and excitement to your players' journey.

## Conclusion
By expanding the possibilities for arcane spellcasters, these new spells offer players a chance to summon their own unique arcane servants. Whether it's an animated weapon, a construct servant, or an elemental ally, these spells add depth and versatility to spellcasting classes. Remember to integrate them into your campaign as part of the adventure, allowing your players to unearth these powerful spells and shape their destiny in the magical world of Dungeons and Dragons.
