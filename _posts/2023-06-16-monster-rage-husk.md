## Rage Husks
In the labyrinthine depths of chaotic realms, there dwell malevolent entities known as a [Mind Reaver]({% link _posts/2023-05-24-monster-mind-reaver.md %}). These beings, aberrations formed from failed attempts to create Mind Flayers, weave their own brand of dark, psychic terror. It's in their destructive wake that the unfortunate victims are morphed into the monstrosities known as Rage Husks. 

Robbed of their sanity and consciousness by the Mind Reavers, the victims are left with nothing but an echo of the pain and fury experienced in their final cognizant moments. This torment is reshaped into a fearsome determination to destroy, creating a formidable, mindless husk fueled by pure rage. 

Rage Husks are often found scattered across the aftermath of a Mind Reaver attack, a chilling reminder of their terrifying power. Furthermore, within the treacherous lairs of these vile creatures, the Mind Reavers maintain a fragile control over the Rage Husks, utilizing them as part of their defensive strategies. As your group delves deeper into these chaotic territories, brace yourself for encounters with these tortured beings, their relentless pursuit a testament to the horrors of the Mind Reaver's touch.

### Mastering Minions: A Page from D&D's 4e Playbook 

Calling all Dungeon Masters seeking to elevate their combat encounters! Let's revisit a technique from D&D's 4th edition that's making a modern comeback, including in [MCDM's 'Flee Mortals'](https://shop.mcdmproductions.com/collections/flee-mortals-the-mcdm-monster-book){:target="_blank"} book: the mighty Minion rule. This simple rule is your key to creating scenes of epic, heroic battles: minions, despite behaving like standard monsters, fall with just one successful hit. But don't discard the minion's hit points just yet. These still matter for spells like Sleep, which operate based on HP.

Whether it's a horde of minions, or adding spice to a boss battle, the Minion rule can turn a routine encounter into a memorable tale of heroic warfare. Harness this tool, and let's take your game to the next level!

Rage Husks also serve as formidable minions when under the control of a powerful adversary like a Mind Reaver, adding a dangerous layer to an already challenging boss fight. But don't limit yourself to what's written here - let your imagination run wild! These psychic zombies could be the consequence of a cursed item, a magical effect gone wrong, or a myriad of other creative plot devices.
