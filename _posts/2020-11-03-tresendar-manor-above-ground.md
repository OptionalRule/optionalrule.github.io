I created this map for a one-shot I created as a prequil to Lost Mines of Phandelver, about the recovery of <a href="https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Tresendar_Mano" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tresendar Manor</a>. It&#8217;s a fairly large map. Created using <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://dungeondraft.net/" target="_blank">DungeonDraft</a>.
