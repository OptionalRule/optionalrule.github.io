**Description:** A finely dressed tall thin human with hawkish features and tightly bound raven hair and high widows peaks. His angular features seem to have frozen his face into a permanent scowl. His skin is flawless and his amber eyes scan people very quickly.

**Personality:** He believes people are spoiled and unwilling to work. That they are made lazy by the march of civilization and that only what he considers hard working people deserve any sort of benefit. He has a taste for the finer things and spends a great deal of money on luxuries, some more exotic than others.

**History:** Gifted from a young age, Arnold studied in Waterdeep where he earned a reputation for profiting by taking advantage of workers. His family was turned out during political infighting and a failed attempt to seize wealth in hopes of becoming a part of the Masked Lords. He and his family returned north, where his grandparents originated and took direct control of salvage and recovery interests. He has built up a small fortune and can afford his own way.

**Motivation:** To form a more stable political alignment with the rich and powerful of the area.

**Occupation:** Artifacts, salvage, criminal enterprises.

**Voice:** Half-singing

**Plot:** Arnold is a member of [The Chardalyn Syndicate][1],
