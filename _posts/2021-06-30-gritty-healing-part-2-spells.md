Earlier in the week I posted some rules for [Gritty Healing & Survival in 5e](). These work well for parties looking for that kind of long term resource management play. However, it leave a bit of a gap when it comes to healing spells and magic. Firstly, it suffers from the problem of turning the cleric into the heal-bot for a party. Secondly, these rules are made moot as the healing spellcasters just unload all their slots on healing before a long rest and top everyone off. So if you're looking to make healing and rest an important part of play, we should include a mechanic to address this.

## Skin In The Game
As it is, healing is just something that falls out of the sky. Be it divine intervention, alchemy, or some other magic.  It costs the recipient nothing and can continue infinitely as long as the party has resources. With these rules, healing still costs the recipient something, otherwise it is horribly inefficient. This has the effect of involving the receiving player in the decision, and managing that as a recourse as well.

### The Rule
A recipient must spend one Hit Die to gain the benefit of a healing spell, potion, or ability. Meaning they must agree to it and that Hit Die is recovered in the same way all are under the Gritty Healing & Survival rules. A healing spell, potion, or ability may still be used on a willing target with no Hit Die to spend or who does not wish to spend a HD.  In this case, the healing works but only does 1 point.

### Notes on Specific Spells and Abilities

* Healing over multiple rounds, such as with ***Healing Spirit***, costs the recipient 1 HD per round.
* ***Goodberry*** is taken off the spell list both because of it's healing effect and invalidating the starvation rules.
* ***Tiny Hut*** works as normal except it does not provide a magical barrier against damage or intrusion. For purposes of Shelter for rest it counts as having proper equipment and cancels out environmental conditions.  
* Spells spell or part of a spell that removes conditions behaves normally.
* Temporary HP are unaffected by these rules.
* Fighters can use ***Second Wind*** without spending Hit Die, but they are considered temporary hit points that last until the end of the next Long Rest.

## Conclusion
These rules close a bit loophole in the original Gritty Healing and Survival rules as presented.  It further reduces the recovery rate of players but serves two purposes. First it doesn't create a situation where healing casters are holding onto all their spell slots to heal everyone. While it can be fun to know that you are keeping the party up and running, this frees them up more to participate directly in encounters. Second, it maintains the long term management aspects by keeping a *Hit Die Economy* in the campaign timescale. Lastly, it encourages dowmtime and other activities not focused on the combat encounter.
