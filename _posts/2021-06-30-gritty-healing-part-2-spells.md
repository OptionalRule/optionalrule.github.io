Earlier in the week I posted some rules for [Gritty Healing & Survival in 5e]({% link _posts/2021-06-27-gritty-healing-and-survival-rules.md %}). These work well for parties looking for that kind of long term resource management play. However, it leave a bit of a gap when it comes to healing spells and magic. Firstly, it suffers from the problem of turning the cleric into the heal-bot for a party. Secondly, these rules are made moot as the healing spellcasters just unload all their slots on healing before a long rest and top everyone off. So if you're looking to make healing and rest an important part of play, we should include a mechanic to address this.

## Skin In The Game
As it is, healing is just something that falls out of the sky. Be it divine intervention, alchemy, or some other magic.  It costs the recipient nothing and can continue indefinitely as long as the party has resources. With these rules, healing spells cost the recipient something, limiting how much they can benefit from spells and abilities. That has the effect of involving the receiving player in the decision, and managing healing as a resource as well.

### The Rule
A recipient must spend one Hit Die to gain the benefit of a healing spell, potion, or ability. Meaning they must agree to being healed a mark off one of their own Hit Die to gain the benefit. A healing spell, potion, or ability may still be used on a willing target with no Hit Die to spend or who does not wish to spend a HD.  In this case, the healing works but only does 1 point.

### Notes on Specific Spells and Abilities

* Healing over multiple rounds, such as with ***Healing Spirit***, costs the recipient 1 HD per round.
* ***Goodberry*** Works as listed.  However if they want to benefit from eating a handfull they must spend a Hit Die as with any other healing.  Otherwise they may eat one berry per action to gain 1 point of healing without spending a Hit Die. Goodberry provides food to prevent starvation but does not count as *Good Food* for the recovery rules in Gritty Healing & Survival.
* ***Lay On Hands*** similar to Goodberry, the recipient must spend a Hit Die to gain the benefit of multiple points of healing.  Otherwise they can receive one point of healing per action without spending a Hit Die.
* ***Tiny Hut*** works as normal except it does not provide a magical barrier against damage or intrusion. For purposes of Shelter for rest it counts as having proper equipment and cancels out environmental conditions.  
* ***Lesser Restoration*** No longer automatically cures any disease. Instead it gives the target an immediate saving throw against the disease at advantage. 
* Spells that removes conditions behaves normally in terms of condition removal but rules above take precedence if there are additional results.
* Temporary HP are unaffected by these rules.
* Fighters can use ***Second Wind*** without spending Hit Die, but they are considered temporary hit points that last until the end of the next Long Rest.


## Conclusion
These rules close a bit loophole in the original Gritty Healing and Survival rules as presented.  It further reduces the recovery rate of players but serves two purposes. First it doesn't create a situation where healing casters are holding onto all their spell slots to heal everyone. While it can be fun to know that you are keeping the party up and running, this frees them up more to participate directly in encounters. Second, it maintains the long term management aspects by keeping a *Hit Die Economy* in the campaign timescale. Lastly, it encourages dowmtime and other activities not focused on the combat encounter.
