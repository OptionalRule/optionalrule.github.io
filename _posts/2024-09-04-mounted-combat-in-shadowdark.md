Greetings, brave crawlers! Whether you're charging into battle, making daring escapes, or simply looking for a reliable way to haul your hard-earned loot, mounts are an essential part of any fantasy adventurer's toolkit. They add a thrilling dimension to gameplay, especially during overland adventures where a simple yet engaging mounted combat system can elevate the excitement of your [Shadowdark](https://www.thearcanelibrary.com/pages/shadowdark){:target="_blank"} game.

In the spirit of Shadowdark's minimalist yet evocative style, I've crafted these concise rules for mounted combat and travel. They're designed to seamlessly integrate with the Shadowdark TTRPG, offering a brief but descriptive framework that expands your options without bogging down gameplay.
These mounted combat rules are part of a larger project, where I'm compiling various travel-related mechanics. In addition to what you'll find here, I've posted some rules for [hebs & foraging]({% link _posts/2024-08-26-expanded-herb-list-for-shadowdark.md %}), and will be writing some rules on setting up camps, and interactive travel. The goal is to create a comprehensive supplement that enriches your overland adventures in the Shadowdark universe.

I'm excited to share these rules with you and eager to hear your thoughts! Please reach out to me on [X (Twitter)](https://x.com/optionalrule){:target="_blank"} to share your feedback, experiences, or suggestions. I'm also in the Shadowdark Discord, so hit me up there. Your input is invaluable as we continue to expand and refine the Shadowdark experience.

## The Power of a Trusty Steed

Crawling in Shadowdark is dangerous buisness, but it's not always delving underground. A reliable mount can be the difference between glory and a cold, lonely grave in the dark forests and dangerous countryside. But how exactly do these majestic beasts enhance your combat prowess? Let's break it down.

When you're astride your mount, you gain a +1 bonus to hit with melee weapons. It's amazing what a little extra height can do for your swing!

#### Charge!

Wielding a polearm atop a charging mount? Add your mount's Strength modifier to your damage. This devastating move requires a straight charge of at least Near distance. 

But beware, brave rider! This tactic cuts both ways. If you're on the receiving end of a charging foe while wielding a polearm, you can add the enemy mount's Strength modifier to your damage to an attack on any rider that has charged you. It's a high-risk, high-reward situation!

#### Mounted Movement

When mounted, you use your trusty steed's movement as your own. This can significantly increase your tactical options on the battlefield or help you outrun that pesky goblin that's been tailing you... Let's just hope they don't have shortbows.

#### The Perils of Riding

However, mounted combat isn't all glory and triumph. There are risks to consider:

1. **Bolting**: If your mount gets spooked (either by fright or by taking half its hit points in damage), you'll need to make a Morale check. Fail, and your mount bolts, carrying you away from the fray—whether you like it or not!

2. **Staying Ahorse**: When your mount rears or stumbles, you'll need to make a hard Strength check to avoid being thrown. No proper saddle? You're rolling with disadvantage, cowboy.

3. **Unseating a Rider**: Enemies can try to knock you off your high horse with a contested Strength check. You get advantage on your roll, but if you fail, it's a long way down.

### Burdens: Carry Capacity of Mounts

Mounts are not just for riding; they're excellent pack animals too:

- Riderless mounts can carry triple the normal Gear Slots.
- Mounts with riders use standard Gear Slots.

*(For more details on Gear Slots, check out page 35 of the Shadowdark rulebook.)*

## Meet the Mounts

Horses are the most common mount or pack animal in most setting, but by no means the only.  In addition to the normal riding Horse presented on *p227* in the Shadowdark TTRPG, here are a few more options for your adventurer.

## Gearing Up Your Mount

Mounts require a bit of gear and care. Tack is generally required to ride or guide a mount, and all actions are at disadvantage without it. Barding is available to safeguard your mount in battle, but only War horses can wear Chain or Plate. While most mounts can forage in a normal or wooded environment, they'll need Feed to gain the benefits of a rest.

| Gear  | Cost | Slots |
|:-----------|:----:|:----------:|
| Tack (Saddle, stirrups, bridle, halter, rein, bit, and harness) | 15 gp | 2 |
| Barding (Leather, Chain, or Plate armor) | 4x | 2x  |
| Feed (3 days) | 2 sp | 1 |

## Adding Flavor: Mount Coats
