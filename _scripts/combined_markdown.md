A ramshackle and squat two story stone building made held together by rotting timbers, with opaque frosted windows and a dilapidated tiled roof. It sits on a side road along the edge of town slightly northeast of the road to Targos.  This is a standard 25x25 battlemap I created for my Rime of the Frostmaiden camapgin, I hope you can use it too.

This former brewery and tavern served as a rallying place for scholars during the closing decades of The Spellplague. Decades of discarded manuscripts, journals, books and other writings accumulated and became a crude library of local lore and obscure works. It has been years since revelers or scholars frequented this place. Today, the taphouse is a tumble of infrequently used brewing supplies interspersed with stacks of dusty and aging written works.

The current proprietor is a bleary eyed halfling named Tricork Barrelbounder (neutral good male commoner), a distant relation to one of the original owners from the taphouses hay day. Tricork speaks with an almost unintelligible slurring to his words, and always appears unkempt and somewhat damp with a pronounced cough. Despite his unkempt demeanor, Tricork has read most of the works in full or part at one time or another and has a knack for recalling obscure facts. After years of being dismissed and his families decline, he is gruff and unwelcoming but willing to help with anyone who takes a gentle hand with him.

Library users have advantage on any Intelligence based skill checks involving local lore while using library resources. Because of the lack of organization, research takes twice as long as normal if Tricork is not helping characters navigate the collection.

I created this map using <a href="https://dungeondraft.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DungeonDraft</a> for use in my version of Rime of the Frostmaiden.

 An NPC I fleshed out for my Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden campaign.  She is the silent and secretive leader of The Harpers in Icewind dale, dedicated to keeping the faction members safe in the wake of assassinations years ago.

## Description

{% include imageframe.html
  figure_class="float-end ms-4"
  src="/assets/img/beldrora_ninedogs-414x585.jpg"
  alt="Headshot of a middle aged woman with a hard look, steal gray eyes, and long curly hair with beads sewn in."
  width="414" height="585"
  caption="Art by Miguel Regodón Harkness"
 %}

This late middle-aged human woman wears thick furs crudely sewed together from random small animal pelts. Her movements are strong and steady, giving her an air of firm assurance. Her graying golden hair tumbles loosely around her head with shells and beads sewn in. She walks with a stiff gait, mainly in her right leg, which is covered in burn scars. Clear and piercing amber eyes and her weathered face carry an air of stoic discipline.

## Personality

She prefers to avoid direct conversations and when people insist on pushing her, she likes to user her dogs surprise or intimidate them. She is a bit of a drinker and has a weakness for anyone who will sit quietly with her and drink.

## Voice

A strained and raspy voice makes it difficult to speak and she prefers to use crude sign language most of the time

## Motivation

The secrecy and integrity of The Harpers is her only concern, although she carefully protects their identities from one another and the outside world, she is dedicated to each of them like they were her own family.

## Occupation

Sled Dog Trainer, she operates a small kennel of dogs in constant rotation in Bryn Shander and is known to sleep in a small room off to the side of the kennel, of late often with the dogs for warmth.

## History

Beldora was born in Bryn Shander. just as her father became increasingly distant from her family, instead choosing to pursue power in Luskan among the Arcane Brotherhood. Beldora&#8217;s father didn&#8217;t care for her much, and the feeling was mutual. Their relationship strained all the more each time he returned to Icewind Dale to seek some magical artifact or power.

She studied with the Druids near Lonelywood but days after completing her studies, she received word that a band of Skortchclaw Orcs were attacking Bryn Shander. Beldora was horrified and rushed home out of concern for her mother, sneaking back into town she discovered her father was leading a conspiracy by the Arcane Brotherhood that caused the Orc attack. In a fight with her father and his conspirators, she was badly burned and wounded, losing most of her voice, but the Orcish attack was repelled.

It is during the fight against her father and the Arcane Brotherhood that recruited by The Harpers. Since then she has risen to be a prominent leader of the faction in Icewind Dale, a detail which she has maintained as a carefully guarded secret, as she has with the identities of any Harper agent in the area. She is cautious to a fault, and primarily uses the animal messengers to communicate with other agents in the region and has a complex system for other physical communication.

Doing in-character voices is a hit or miss prospect for some games, and by no means required in a table-top RPG. As a DM that enjoys doing voices for various NPCs in my world I find this table helpful to develop different inspiration for voice types I might use, and having a reference like this lets me make a quick note so I can be sure to use the same voice next time. I compiled this list from a few descriptions for theater actors around the web and hope you&#8217;ll find it useful for your game as well.

|29-30|High Pitched – Very high and shrill.|

|41-42|Matter of fact – blunt and flat.|
|43-44|Modulated – Controlled and pleasant to listen to.|
|45-46|Monotonous – Boring because it does not change in loudness or become higher or lower.|

Remixes have become a great way for DMs to talk about how they are using published content in the wild for their actual 5th edition games. It focuses on how you arrange or change the elements to suit your individual game and style, and avoids the o-so-very-internet thing of labeling things as broken or awesome.

I am currently running a <a href="https://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/icewind-dale-rime-frostmaiden" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">D&D Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden</a> campaign and I&#8217;m enjoying it very much. I like the module, I think it has great atmosphere and an interesting take on pacing and the adventure as a whole. The module has taken a lot of heat for things like balance, pacing, editing, etc, and all the things people love to complain about online. I have to say that I think these concerns and complaints are significantly overblow, a number of people are now running this module and it seem to be working out for them. 

_The key to realize is that most of the things people complain need work in the module, are things I would have changed in the module anyway._

I have yet to meet a module or piece of content, even ones I&#8217;ve written myself, that I don&#8217;t change, adjust, or tweak to my liking for a particular game or situation. That&#8217;s kind of what running a game is about. Creating a customized experience not just based on your own taste and style as a DM, but to the individual pacing, playstyles and story of an individual game. All games need adjustment, and by their nature, campaigns are a derivative work at best.

So that leads me back to the idea of Remixes. I love seeing the real world experiences of DMs at-the-table and how they are adjusting the module to run well for their sessions. I&#8217;ll be posting a series here in the near future of my own remixes. Little vignettes for different elements and how I&#8217;ve readjusted them to fit my own needs in hopes that you find some utility in it yourself. Stay tuned and watch the blog or follow me on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/optionalrule" target="_blank">Twitter</a> to follow this and all the content I&#8217;m generating. I also do a lot of theorycrafting for these remixes in my <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.twitch.tv/optionalrule" target="_blank">weekly game-prep and D&D discussion livestream</a> on Twitch at noon on Saturdays so I hope you&#8217;ll join me there.

Happy Gaming!

title: No, racism is not required in a fantasy world
author: Scott Turnbull
layout: post
description: A discussion of why racial essentialism is not needed, does not add anything, and hurts in 5th edition TTRPGs
categories:
  - Misc

---
I had one of those unpleasant exchanges on a Dungeons & Dragons 5e group the other day, where you offer some resource that works for you and someone comes out of left field and goes on a racist tirade. It&#8217;s social media and I&#8217;m pretty good at ignore things like that personally, but the idea that folks new to the hobby might not realize the cheap tactics and toxic behavior behind replies like the one I got.

I&#8217;m not going to go too far into it but the core of the issue was someone posted asking if anyone actually uses hard and soft limits as discussed in the recently released Tasha&#8217;s Caldron of Everything. (Bravo to WotC for including this in an official book btw). My reply was to say that I do use this and have been for awhile, and how it&#8217;s been very effective for me. By way of example I included a bullet list of the Baseline Safety & Consent guidelines I created for this for my most recent campaign using Rime of the Frostmaiden. The guidelines are pretty straightforward:

  * Horror, Mental/Physical Health &#8211; Describe as needed, part of module, not gratuitous or dwelled on.
  * Harm to children &#8211; Not an element, implied or indirect.
  * Mind Control &#8211; Not in RP, encounter based (i.e. confusion spell).
  * Sexual Content &#8211; Implied, part of background, fade to black.
  * Not part of the game: Homophobia, Abuse, Racism, Real-world religion, Sexism, gratuitous cruelty, etc.
  * Local cultural conflicts or prejudices may exist.
  * Racial essentialism is not a part of play, comes down to local culture as appropriate for The Forgotten Realms.
  * Some themes used around drinking and poverty.
  * Anyone can call for pause, rewind or skip ahead on uncomfortable material.
  * Players will have a consent list they can fill out in session 0.
  * Please bring up any topics we should be aware of.

The trigger for this person was the line &#8220;_Racial essentialism is not a part of play, comes down to local culture as appropriate for The Forgotten Realms._&#8221; This was too much for them and it launched a reply thread at forty and growing ,of this person trying claim that racism is an inseparable part of any fantasy world and that the game must be unplayable if it does not include it. It&#8217;s not my way to generally engaged in fights on social media, particularly when the person is simply trying to score points and acting in bad faith while trying to hide behind a veneer of intellectualism. However I wanted to add a reply for the folks in the thread that might be new to D&D so they did not buy into this line of thinking.

Here is what I added:

{% include quote.html
quote="'I do not intend for this to be a discussion about race in games. The topic is too expansive to cover properly on Facebook. Instead I will address the general misconception that racism is so ingrained into a world view that you cannot even imagine a fantasy world where it&#8217;s not a significant part of play. One need only read an author like Ursula K Le Guin, who so elegantly presented a popular and dangerous fantasy setting free of the idea that you must have racism baked into it to be valid. One could argue that even a series as violent as The Song of Ice and Fire is largely free or racism. Obviously not free of culture conflict or other problems, but somehow they managed to present a fantasy world where nobody ever screams something simply based on someone&#8217;s race or skin color, never has the town guard killed someone simply because of their skin color, and never get into discussions of plummeting house prices simply because a dwarf moved into the neighborhood. So if you&#8217;re new to TTRPGs, please don&#8217;t fall for the lie that fantasy worlds can&#8217;t be separated from this thinking and please don&#8217;t fall for the ploy that this must absolutely be true and now it&#8217;s your responsibility to prove them wrong. It&#8217;s just toxic.'"
caption = "My reply to Facebook Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition group post."
 %}'

That&#8217;s it, there&#8217;s no great insight in this post. This is one of those things that either you immediately get or you have a lot of personal work to do. Those of us who have been in the hobby for a long time however, should have some go to reasoning to help newer members from getting caught up in all of that.

title: 'Thrilling Heroics Rules for D&D 5e'
author: Scott Turnbull

image: /assets/img/grog_by_nickroblesart-384x301.jpg
description: Add more dynamic and thrilling heroics to your 5th edition game with these rules.
categories:
  - RPG Resources

---

Thrilling heroics have always been an important part of adventuring in table-top roleplaying games. The rules of 5th edition are great for covering most basic action but occasionally players want something more exciting to happen. The swashbuckler may want to distract opponents by kicking the table at them, or the cavalier leaps from their charging horse to make a more devastating attack, this is all part of thrilling heroic action at the heart of adventure based roleplaying games.

{% include imageframe.html
  figure_class="float-end ms-4 clearfix"
  src="/assets/img/grog_by_nickroblesart-384x301.jpg"
  alt="A goliath barbarian leaping in the air about to strike with their axe."
  width="384" height="301"
  caption="Image Credit Nick Robles"
 %}

Spectacular heroic action itself adds a lot to an encounter, but what makes an action thrilling is the risk that goes along with it. Players who want to attempt some daring action that creates an extra effect, should offer some option for how they do it and what the drawback is if they fail. As with most things in 5th edition, this usually takes the form of stating some goal, picking a skill and stating what the outcome is for success or failure and rolls against a difficulty set by the DM.

The most simple case is the player asks for some action to create a bonus to an action, the DM says they have to succeed on skill check or lose the action entirely. In this case the reward is some simple bonus, and the risk is that they have to essentially succeed on two rolls to pull of an action or lose it altogether. Greater bonuses or effects may require putting something more at risk.

## Heroic Action!

Heroics are some action that grants a bonus, advantage, or some condition that isn&#8217;t normally allowed or available through the normal rules. Some examples of things players might try to gain from a heroic action are:

### Example Heroics

|Bonus|Impact|
|--- |--- |
|+1 bonus|Minor|
|+1d4 bonus|Minor|
|Disadvantage for opponent|Moderate|
|Advantage for player|Moderate|
|Additional damage die|Moderate|
|Push the use of an ability|Significant|
|Add significan new effect or combine effects|Significant|
{: .table .table-striped .table-hover .data-table }

## Thrilling Risks!

Heroics are some action that grants a bonus, advantage, or some condition that isn&#8217;t normally allowed or available through the normal rules. Some examples of things players might try to gain from a heroic action are:

|Risk|Impact|
|--- |--- |
|Loss of half movement|Minor|
|Require a skill roll|Minor|
|Player disadvantage|Moderate|
|One opponent advantage|Moderate|
|Take extra die of damage|Moderate|
|Invoke Attack of Opportunity|Moderate|
|All opponents advantage|Significant|
|Fall prone|Significant|
|Loss of Action|Significant|
|Loss of Turn|Very Significant|
{: .table .table-striped .table-hover .data-table }

## Difficulty

By their very nature, an action the generates new options would be difficult or hard to pull off. Otherwise it wouldn&#8217;t be very spectacular and anyone would do it. The DC for a roll typically starts at DC 15 or higher depending on the difficulty of the situation and effect they are trying to achieve. The DM should declare the difficulty before the player decides to proceed with the action so they can determine if this is a risk they are willing to take.

## Balancing Things Out

The core idea of Thrilling Heroics is that they balance risks with rewards in 5th edition games. These are not intended to create new mechanics, imply a new contract with the DM and are always expected to be adhoc actions to add excitement to a game, not be a replacement for the rules or cause action creep into the game.

When requesting some sort of heroic action there are a few things to keep in mind to keep this from going off the rails. Heroics are generally creating an opportunity for something they might reasonably have access too. It&#8217;s generally a good idea to avoid allowing access to features or abilities not available until later in the game, such as multiple attacks. Likewise it&#8217;s generally good to avoid granting a character access to some ability or feature that is a unique aspect of another characters class or role.

It can&#8217;t be emphasised enough that balancing these requests is not only important to maintain the challenge of a game, but for inclusion of play styles as well. Some players are naturally more introverted and, others might be more talkative and coming up with Thrilling Heroics more often. Granting more advantages to players who just talk more is a disservice to players with a more introverted or cautious style of play. Balancing these advantages with potential risks maintains a healthy respect for different play-styles.

## Examples

The types and variations of possible requests are near infinite and limited only by the groups imagination. This is what is so fantastic about table-top roleplaying games and what sets them apart from something like a video game. It does make it difficult however and for this to work, everyone needs to be bought into this as a fun addition to the game. Some examples of a Thrilling Heroic action might be:

  * &#8220;Can I kick the table in front of us at the enemy to block their vision for a moment before I attack? I&#8217;ll roll Deception to try to give me advantage on so I can sneak attack, if I fail I lose my attack.&#8221;
  * &#8220;Can I leap off my charging horse and attack the enemy with an extra die of damage. I&#8217;ll roll athletics and if I fail I fall prone and take one die off damage.&#8221;
  * &#8220;Can I throw the lantern in front of the archers to create smoke that gives them disadvantage on shooting at us. If I miss I might hit one of the PCs?&#8221;
  * &#8220;Can I use my whip to try to grab the weapon out of their hands so I have it if I sacrifice my actin surge?&#8221;
  * &#8220;Can I use acrobatics to tumble through the group of enemies and avoid attacks of opportunities, if I fail I&#8217;ll stop in the middle and the first attack on me has advantage.&#8221;
  * &#8220;Can I try to wake up an unconscious character at 1 hp with a Medicine Check, if I fail they will start to make death saves again, starting with 1 failed save?&#8221; (Note this would require consent of the other character)
  * &#8220;With my rope tied to my ice axe, can I throw it and try to pull the hag down off of the wall? I&#8217;ll roll and shove attack, and the rope snaps if I fail and I lose my weapon.&#8221;

This post contains the remixes and changes I used for the Lake Monster quest picked up in the town of Bremen in <a href="https://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/icewind-dale-rime-frostmaiden">Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden</a>. It runs similarly to what is written in the module with a different backstory, delivery and climax. You can likely use this remix as an independent encounter in any game, but to get the most out of it you will need the module.

<div class="alert alert-secondary">Contains some spoilers for the Lake Monster question in Rime of the Frostmaiden. The content focuses on new or changed materials but comments may imply spoilers.</div>

## Overview

A frost druid (see appendix C of RotF) named Arson (NE, genderless Water Genasi) is awakening animals in and along the shores of Maur Dualdon. They have recently awakened a plesiosaurus and are forcing it to help with their goal of ridding Maur Dualdon of humanoid influence by holding its clutch of eggs hostage in a cavern grotto. The plesiosaur has been told to attack and kill the fisherfolk on the lake to drive them out, but has no real desire to fight or kill. So far it has managed to harass and drive away fisherfolk, primarily near it&#8217;s former home along the eastern shore near Bremen. The frost druid circle is growing impatient with the beast, insisting that only death will send the proper message and threatening the plesiosaur&#8217;s eggs if it does not obey soon.

This quest runs similar to the original. The PCs get to Bremen and hear of a monster harassing and attacking fisherfolk on the lake. They are hired by Grynsky Berylborn, aging fishmaster of Bremen (see module for more details), to find and kill the creature before it is too late and someone dies. They will get a bit more foreshadowing that there might be more to the creature&#8217;s story and an opportunity to interact with it if they choose. The players can decide if they want to take a straight run and kill the creature, gather more information and get to the bottom of things, hear the creature out, or even work to help free it from the influence of the frost druids and save the creatures eggs.

_**Note to pendants**: Plesiosaurs didn&#8217;t lay eggs. This breed does._

## Getting the Quest

This section runs much as it does in the module, the players find Grynsky as they enter town who hires them, Tali comes along and gives her information. Tali will add that so far, nobody has tied to the creature, though in the last encounter one of the fisherfolk had their hand bit off. Questioning any of the fisherfolk who have encountered the beast will net a similar story, the creature began by ramming the bottom of their boat but not hard enough to capsize or sink it, some who pounded the water with oars or weapons got snapped at. A few feel overboard in the melee, but the beast did not attack them and it left the boats alone once they turned back toward town. 

The plesiosaur has befriended an elderly couple that lives a short way to the north of Bremen, a human man and women, who can help shed light on the situation if the players care to investigate or help.

If the PCs spend some time questing the townsfolk they can roll Charisma (Investigation) and discover a varying amount of info depending on the success of the roll. I recommend having a single player make one roll for the a few hours of gathering information, if another player is proficient in investigation allow them to roll as well, using the best result between the two checks.

|Investigation|Information|
|--- |--- |
|5+|This started a few months ago, nobody has died; There have been several dozen incidents.|
|10+|The creature begins by ramming the boat, but no boats have capsized or sunk; It stops if the boat flees; Plesiosaurs typically avoid people.|
|15+|The creature has attacked people if the crew attacks it with oars or weapons. Recently the attacks have happened more frequently; One crew member had their hand bitten off after attacking the beast with a harpoon.|
|20+|One or two crew members have falling into the water during an attack, the beast did not attack them.|
|25+|The players discover the Del’Ladderans, if the players can earn their trust they may reveal the information in their section below.|

This encounter runs much as it does in the module with additions or modifications listed here. I recommend not depending on the late events table, unless your group would enjoy that sort of thing, and instead moving to an encounter with the plesiosaur after a few hours on the water. The beast will begin by ramming and pushing the boat (see Plesiosaurus Behavior option 2 in the module), this continues for several minutes, if the players attack the creature it responds in kind (moving to Plesiosaurus Behavior option 3 in the module). If the creature takes more than half it&#8217;s hitpoints in damage, it swims away. Players may be surprised that it speaks in a pleading tone as it departs, &#8220;Please, just go away!&#8221;. If somehow, the players can get the creatures attention

### Talking to the Del&#8217;Ladderans

An elderly couple living just north of Bremen, Igmar (M, human 78) and Darcia (F, human 75) Del&#8217;Ladderan, will approach the players shortly after returning to Bremen or find them at any location they travel to after encountering the creature. They will urgently ask to speak to the players in private on an important matter. If the players agree they will relate the following information.

  * They were fishing on the lake some months back when the creature began harassing them much like it did the other boats. They reflexively asked &#8220;Please don&#8217;t do this.&#8221; and the creature stopped, emerged from the water and began talking to them about it&#8217;s situation.
  * They have befriended the creature, visiting it on the lakeshore where it brings them the occasional fish to eat.
  * They know the thing is being forced to attack the townsfolks and why, they have not spoken of this to anyone out of fear of putting the creature in danger.
  * They are talking to the group because the situation is becoming more desperate and the druids are threatening to destroy the eggs if the creature does not begin to kill people as they ask.
  * The couple see the adventurers as the creatures only chance for freedom.

If the players wish to pursue this plotline and help the beast, the couple will lead them to a private part of the lake and call the beast with a flute they were playing on the lake when they first encountered it. The beast will arrive and the players can move to the Talking to the Plesiosaurus Section.

### Talking to the Plesiosaurus

This encounter runs much as it does in the module with additions or modifications listed here. The storyline that it does the bidding of the druids out of ignorance of the awaken condition is replaced with the situation that Revisin&#8217;s Druid Circle found the lakeshore cavern it uses as a lair and is holding the creatures clutch of eggs hostage to force it to do it&#8217;s bidding. The conversation can offer the following information:

  * “The human who gave me this gift is named Ravisin and claimed to serve the Frostmaiden. Ravisin said I must do my part to help rid the shores of this lake from the corruption of humanoids.”
  * &#8220;Rasvisin threatens my eggs, they will harm my brood if I do not do as they say.
  * &#8220;My home is north along the shore where Rasvisin and their followers now dewell, keeping my eggs hostage.&#8221;

The plesiosaur has little understanding of commerce and value, but it can offer a treasure it knows to lay at the bottom of the lake if the players will help. It describes it as a wrecked boat, inside is a glowing orb (drift globe), and a chest with shiny coins (75gp in various coins). It can offer to retrieve these items for the players if they help it drive the druids from its lair.

It tells the players Rasvisin is too powerful and they should not face them. It knows it must go to the northern part of the lake and speak to Rasvisin every few days now that they have grown impatient with it, and the players would be best able to attack the caves while Rasvisin is gone.

If the players agree, proceed to Encounter at the Lakeside Cavern.

## Encounter at the Lakeside Cavern

In a small, half submerged cave two miles north of Bremen along the lakeshore, a small group of druids have occupied the former lair of the Plesiosaur and are holding it&#8217;s eggs hostage. Neither the players, nor the plesiosaur are aware the druid have no intention of destroying the eggs and are merely using them as leverage against the creature. Ultimately if the creature does not do their biding they intend to kill it in an ambush, hatch and raise the broodlings after awakening them, in hopes they will be more compliant to the druids goals.

The encounter itself is straight-forward. There is 1 acolyte per 2 PCs and 1 tribal warrior for each PC (2 tribal warriors if they are 2nd level) held up in the cavern who hold an inattentive guard at a small break near the back that emerges above ground. The main entrance to the cavern is underwater, below the ice. The chamber itself is a large irregular shaped oval, two thirds of the the southern side is water leading to the exit, and the northern water smoothed cavern rocks and with a thin roof of stalactites. The cavern itself is a somewhat comfortable temperature due to geothermal energy far below. There are half a dozen eggs against the warmest wall on the far northern side.

The members of the druid circle are fanatics who will give their lives for the Frostmaiden. They may threaten but will not destroy the eggs as their master has plans for them.

## Wrapping things up

As with any adventure, the players can choose how they want to approach it, so choose the outcome that best fits their actions. Some of the broad possibilities are listed below.

  * If they pass on this mission, the town will become very unwelcoming to the party. The beast attacks will continue to escalate until finally some townsfolk die. In more time the townsfolk eventually hire some whalers who trap and kill the beast, it&#8217;s carcase washes up on shore, mourned by the Del&#8217;Ladderan&#8217;s.
  * If the players kill the beast, they collect the reward from the townsfolk as promised. If they take notes for Tali and include any information that the beast was intelligent, she will be horrified and only begrudgingly give half the reward to the players.
  * If the players defeat the acolytes and druids in the lakeside cavern, they will receive the reward promised, the gratitude of the creature who will say it is moving the eggs to a new location it will not disclose. 
      * The players are welcome at the Del&#8217;Laddern&#8217;s at any time who will let them share in their meager supplies.
      * The townsfolk will be skeptical of giving a reward with no proof of a body, but will agree to pay if a month passes with no further attacks.
  * Resvisin will remember and eventually learn of the players betrayal. This sets up a possible revenge plot later if you&#8217;re inclined, or you could tie them to The White Moose quest in Lonelywood to setup a series of encounters with Resvisin as a BBG for it all.

So that&#8217;s it. My remix of this encounter. I hope you get something out of it and enjoy!

title: 'Tools to Affect Rolls in D&D'

description: An analysis and ranking of different roll effecting mechanisms in 5th edition TTRPGs.
categories:
  - Analysis

---
Owing to a small thread on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/optionalrule/status/1345183662703337472" target="_blank">twitter</a> earlier this week, I listed out the options 5th Edition Dungeons and Dragons provides for effecting rolls. This is useful for creating your own roll effecting homebrew rules, if you want to understand the relative power level compared to other elements in the ruleset.

Before diving into the list it&#8217;s important to draw a distinction between two different meta-classes of roll modifications in 5th edition. Those are modifications that **add to the result** of a die roll, and modifications that **replace the value** of the die roll. This is important for rolls that can produce a critical success, as rolls that replace a value give more opportunities to score a critical. So when ranking the value of a role modification, it&#8217;s important to know if the roll can critically succeed or not.

It&#8217;s also worth noting that not all roll benefits are equal so it&#8217;s not as straightforward to compare benefits. Advantage for instance would seem to provide a statistical equivalent lower then the +5 referenced in the system, however advantage doesn&#8217;t just provide a bonus to the roll, it turns a linear probably distribution to a slightly curved one. See the posts I link near the bottom of the article since the importance of this depends largely on the DC of the roll. The point here being not all benefits are so easily compared and it speaks a bit to the wonderful complexity of making things work in a 5th edition game.

These are the levels of dials and levers for 5th edition rolls to consider to guide your house rule design: 

**Ranked by effect on normal rolls.**

  * Bardic Inspiration (lvl 5/10/15):+d8/ +d10/+d12
  * Advantage
  * Bardic Inspiration (lvl1/5): +d6 
  * Guidance/Bless: +d4
  * Luck: (reroll 1s)
  * Bane: -d4 (and Half Cover)
  * Disadvantage (and Three-Quarters Cover)

**Ranked by effect on rolls that can have a critical success.**

<ul>
  <li>
    Elven Accuracy
  </li>
  <li>
    Advantage
  </li>
  <li>
    Bardic Inspiration (All)
  </li>
  <li>
    Guidance/Bless: +d4
  </li>
  <li>
    Luck: (reroll 1s)
  </li>
  <li>
    Bane: -d4 (and Half Cover)
  </li>
  <li>
    Three-Quarters Cover
  </li>
  <li>
    Disadvantage
  </li>
</ul>

Note I&#8217;m including cover here, which doesn&#8217;t actually modify the die roll but adds to AC, which is an indirect way to modify an attack roll so I&#8217;m including it as a relative comparison.

Further note, in terms of its benefit to a roll that can critically hit, Luck is rather hard to rank as a rerolled one might actually result in a critical so there&#8217;s a good argument to be made to putting this higher on the list.

In a debate about what the actual outcome of Elven Accuracy might be, I did some quick scripting to simulate 100k rolls to find out what the median result would be of a roll, and what percentage of rolls would crit if it were an attack. Anyone interested in the sloppy code I put together to do this simulation can view it online <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://onlinegdb.com/BJi8LL06D" target="_blank">here</a>. The results of that were interesting to me and might help you assess the various impact of roll modifications you might be considering for your house rules.

  * Median roll with Eleven Accuracy is 16.0 and 14% are crits.
  * Median roll with Advantage is 15.0 and 10% are crits.
  * Median roll on a normal 1d20 is 11.0 and 5% are crits.
  * Median roll with Disadvantage is 6.0 and 0% are crits.

Just a note on criticals and disadvantage, since I get the question. It&#8217;s just reading as 0%, there is actually some minimal number rounding to zero. Locally, at disadvantage the only way you crit is by rolling double 20s which is a 1 in 400 chance, so roughly 0.25%.

There&#8217;s a great additional take on rolls and outcomes by <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/thedicemechanic" target="_blank">@TheDiceMechanic</a> over on their blog you might want to check out titled <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://dicemechanic.wordpress.com/2014/09/23/advantage-to-the-max/" target="_blank">Advantage to the Max</a> as well. It explores another important consideration in roll modifications, how many rolls would be below 10.

title: Progressive Failures and Rising Tension in 5th Edition

description: Methods to build tension and excitement with failures and successes in your 5th edition TTRPG.

  - RPG Resources

---
5th edition Dungeons and Dragons has a bit of a rough patch with its skill checks model. Given the variability of a d20, all or nothing skill checks can be a fairly harsh mechanic. Indeed, there&#8217;s some evidence all or nothing checks is not the designers intent. The DMG Chapter 8 provides some alternative methods to consider with skill resolution under [Resolution and Consequences](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/running-the-game#ResolutionandConsequences) which all hinge on a single die roll mechanic. In cases, there may be some utility using a progressive success or failure system instead of a single checks. Particularly in non-combat encounters, it is best to build skill checks in a way to build tension from failure rather than a collapse. <a href="https://dmdavid.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">DMDavid</a> sparked a thought after a specific example <a href="https://twitter.com/optionalrule/status/1345790204758679556" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">posted on twitter</a>, how to handle falling with failed climbing checks. Progressive failure and rising tension meshes well with the [Thrilling Heroics Rules]({% link _posts/2020-12-22-thrilling-heroics-rules-for-dd-5e.md %}) I posted awhile back. In fact, it compliments it enough that I thought it useful to post some examples here.

Before I dig too deep, I intend this to be used as another option mixed in with some of the excellent options presented in <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/running-the-game#ResolutionandConsequences" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resolution and Consequences</a> in Chapter 8 of the DMG.

## Progressive Rolls in a Nutshell

The core game principle is fairly simple, wherever possible the DM can create more tension in a game by progressing the tension with failed skill rolls. I think in these cases a rule of three model would seem to work. Simply that is:

  * 1st Failure: No progress
  * 2nd Failure: Unable to advance without help or change.
  * 3rd Failure: Consequences

At each stage along the way, the DM should increase the stakes more. Players can turn the failure around by changing something or accepting some additional risk. The idea is to keep agency in the hands of the the players. In this way, they are able to make decisions and manage their risk as the tension builds.

  alt="A group of adventurers leaning over a table, seemingly confused by a map they are looking at"
  height="363" width="480"
  caption="Image credit Wizards of the Coast"
 %}

## Why this is Useful

Single roll success or failure models can be bad when failure is catastrophic. For instance, a climbing check that causes you to fall if you fail the roll by more than five. This is a bad model because the variability of a d20 is so high that putting everything onto a single roll is a bad idea. This is particularly bad if failure means they plummet to their death. 

Instead, let&#8217;s use an example with the rule of three model.  
  
**Example with Climb Check:** The first athletics fail results in no progress. The second failure means the character is stuck and cannot progress without help or significant risk. At this point something needs to change to allow them to progress, meaning either another character climbs over to help them, or some new spell or equipment comes into play. **_Alternatively, the character can now choose to try to climb again, but this time the risk is if they fail, they fall!_**

**Example with a Stealth Check:** The first stealth failure results in the character not being able to move without revealing themselves. The second failure means they are stuck and others are alerted enough to begin to investigate. At this point something else needs to happen, perhaps another character creates a distraction or they use a spell of some sort. Alternatively, the character can risk one last stealth check, perhaps at disadvantage, with the risk of raising the alarm.

## General Use 

You can extend this thinking to many types of skill checks. For instance, investigations don&#8217;t progress and getting unstuck risks offending, alerting, or misunderstanding something. Disabling traps might risk sealing a passageway, alerting nearby creatures, or triggering it at an auto failed save or critical damage. It can vary by skill but it&#8217;s worth thinking about, particularly for scenarios where combat is not the main focus.

Obviously, these are fuzzy situations, as with most rulings in 5th edition, the DM has to choose the right method for determining outcome based on pacing and the situation. Too often though, DMs reach for the pass/fail mechanic. There&#8217;s some work to do on the DMs part to determine what a success means, is it a reset back to zero, does it just progress the character back to being stuck? Are the risky third rolls made at disadvantage? There&#8217;s no way to tell, and this part of the craft of the DM as they reach for the proper tool to manage tension in the game. In my own case, remembering to do it in the midst of trying to keep the game moving can work against me, but if you have a situation where you want to build tension around non-combat action in game, a DM might consider this method of resolution.

**Update 1/6/2021**

Several folks have linked Matt Colville&#8217;s video &#8220;Many Fail States&#8221; which compliments this as well. Thank you so much for the folks that reached out to send me this link. Adding the video here and recommend you check it out for additional thoughts on the topic.

---

With the publication of Tasha&#8217;s Caldron of Everything, the game introduced the concepts of Supernatural Regions to 5th edition Dungeons and Dragons. Areas that have variable and mysterious effects that might be invoked by specific actions or conditions. Within Icewind Dale are localized arcane phenomenon zones said to manifest The Heart of Winter, that is the conjunction of planar regions brought into alignment with Icewind Dale as a function of Auril&#8217;s ongoing enchantments. Small clusters of these supernatural phenomenon ebb and flow across the region and it has been growing in frequency, intensity, and size as time progresses.

Arcane scholars suspect casting of spells such as Control Weather, Magnificent Mansion, or similar spells may cause one of these regions to manifest.

## The Heart of Winter Supernatural Region

Consider rolling on the Heart of Winter Magical Effects table when the following circumstances occur in one of these regions. 

  * After spending more than an hour resting.
  * A creature is brought to zero hit points.
  * A spell is cast that does Thunder, Cold, or Fire damage.
  * An open flame is produced naturally or by a spell.
  * A creature is Paralyzed

The Ten-Towns of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/icewind-dale-rime-frostmaiden" target="_blank">Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden</a> provide rich plot, roleplaying, and excellent modular encounters for your 5th edition Dungeons and Dragons game. These early adventures setup the core tension of the adventure, and provide some of the most obvious ways to allow heroes make an impact on the region. What follows here are a few updates, changes, or additions to Ten-Towns to spice up your sessions in different ways. The factions section below provide a bit more political context to the adventure, the Sacrifices to Auril section provides a bit more background and context for the dangers faced and how each town is adapting, the Winter Survival Gear and Travel section enhance the survival mechanics in the setting. Like any remix, this is just a skew toward a specific style of running the game, use what you find useful and ignore the rest. Many of these core components setup remixes for individual encounters I will post over time.

## Access to Icewind Dale

Travel in and out of the region is all but blocked. The mountain passes are buried in heavy snow and carry the ever present danger of avalanche from two years of snowfall, The passages through the underdark are controlled by the Duergar, who have the upper hand in their war with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Mithral_Hall" target="_blank">Mithral Hall</a>. Sea ice has continued to build up, making passage by ship a very dangerous affair. The only regular means of travel in and out of the region since the start of Auril&#8217;s Reign of Terror, has been the monthly trek of The Bright Moon Caravan helping people flee the region and bringing in much needed supplies.

As mentioned much of this information establishes a baseline for other elements of the remix I will be posting, so I am providing this summary here for a central reference.

## Factions

### The Bright Moon Caravan

Lead by dwarves of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Clan_Battlehammer" target="_blank">Clan Battlehammer</a>, the Bright Moon Caravan is the main supply line for Ten-Towns. Just before the full moon each month, traders and travelers gather in the square of Bryn Shander to join the caravan. Trained <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Bulette" target="_blank">Bulettes</a> are used to plow through the mountain pass along [Ten-Trail][1] toward the town of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Hundelstone" target="_blank">HundleStone</a> where southern traders gather every month. The caravan is a vital supply line, allowing the Ten-Towns to hang on. It serves as an excellent way for player characters to enter the region in the early game, and one of the few ways for the unfortunate to leave.

### The Chardalyn Syndicate

The Chardalyn Syndicate is a lose confederation of affluent people and business owners in Ten-Towns. They began coordinating before Auril&#8217;s reign of terror, with the goal of taking over the Council of Speakers. Their goals vary by member, but largely involve control of commerce within the Ten-Towns to control trade of the unique resources found in the region. Since the long winter has fallen, members have become more militant and actively seek to undermine and control the council, either because they feel they can make the &#8220;hard decisions&#8221; needed to survive or because they see an opportunity to prosper from the chaos. Members use various means to undermine the local speaker and gain public support for efforts in their town. The most effective means of late has been smuggling additional supplies to the townspeople through a secret alliance with the Duragar, while helping their allies attack the Bright Moon Caravan to ensure they are the only reliable suppliers.

Members have taken to wearing a small broach of Chardalyn crystal shaped into a rose, frequently send messages back and forth in code, and meet only rarely.

#### Intrigue & Survival: The Duergar Alliance

Seizing on the opportunity to make the townsfolks more dependent on them and to undermine the authority of The Speakers Council, The Chardalyn Syndicate has formed an alliance with Xardorok Sunblight of the Duergar. From their point of view, they can use Xardorok to bring in supplies and he will become a reliable market for Chardalyn crystals once they fully control the region. Though this alliance they secretly smuggle in supplies each month and make a show of distributing them in the town when they arrive, few have asked questions of how they get these supplies. At the same time, they provide information to the Duergar who have begun ambushing the Bright Moon Caravan in hopes of shutting down that supply line and further strengthening their position. In this remix, I&#8217;ll provide some scenarios related to unravelling this alliance.

##### Members

Each member of the Chardalyn Syndicate operates a small cadre of lackys, enforcers, spies, and servants in their respective towns. They frequently send messages back and forth in code but meet only rarely. Naerth is the primary leader, and in the strongest position being the only member to win their way into The Speakers Counsel.

  * **Naerth Maxidanarr (Targos)** &#8211; (See RotF Targos) Only member to be on The Speakers Council. Leader of Syndicate.
  * **Tomi Delbore (Termalaine)** &#8211; (new NPC, 42 year old female NE Human Veteran) Head of the local town guard, she barely lost to the current speaker in a bitterly contested election recently. She blatantly withholds support for the speaker and makes great pains to let everyone know that whatever she does do for the town is at her discretion.
  * **Arnold Bietz (Bryn Shander)** &#8211; (new NPC, 57 yr old male LE Half-Elf Noble) A crafty businessman and owner of Bietz Salvage, a franchise with outposts in several towns. He is the wealthiest member of the Syndicate and has the most connections to merchant houses along the Sword Coast.
  * **Jetta Keenseeker (Easthaven)** &#8211; (new NPC, 78 yr old female NE Dwarf Noble) Recently Murdered by Dzaan (see Public Execution section in Easthaven) after an attempt to have her guides abandon Dzaan in the wilderness to die in hopes of recovering their magic items. Jetta operated the largest fishing team on the lake as well as the Easthaven Ferry. She also operated the regions smugglers guild, and is the primary point of coordination in bringing in supplies from the Duergar. With her death her organization is in a power struggle between lieutenants.

### The Duergar

The Duergar&#8217;s plans to undermine the region continue on much as in the module. The added dimension is their alliance with The Chardalyn Syndicate, which Xardorok sees as a valuable way to get information about the towns, access to Chardalyn, and a means for his agents to better operate. From his point of view, once he has helped the short-sighted members of The Chardalyn Syndicate disrupt the Ten-Towns, he only need withdraw his support and isolate them to do what he pleases with them. While he is building up his forces, he is happy to allow just enough supplies through the underdark passages he controls to give the people a false hope. Elements of the Duergar faction are spread across Icewind Dale secretly searching for Chardalyn crystals to supply Xardorok&#8217;s war machine. 

## Getting Around Ten Towns

Given travel times, even short distances could take days of travel, and modifying the travel times provideds a bit more consistency and a progression of options the party can use to establish goals. These changes here are slightly different than the ones presented on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/45138/roleplaying-games/icewind-dale-travel-times" target="_blank">The Alexandrian</a> website, but I wanted to link their article as it&#8217;s of tremendous use. Of note, this remix establishes Axe Beaks as effective winter mounts in addition to their utility as pack animals. 

The travel rates below are new base travel rates, not difficult terrain, which seems to be a point of confusion in the game. The first day after a blizzard, after an avalanche, traveling over ice, and other conditions may still cause difficult terrain. It is not clear from the write-up if Dogsleds have their rest period included in the base travel time, this remix assumes it does not and rest is a resource to manage by players for their dogsled team.

If the party travels across overland terrain in Icewind Dale for more than four hours in a day, they must succeed on a DC 10 <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#GroupChecks" target="_blank">group</a> Constitution (Survival) check or suffer a level of exhaustion. They must repeat this check every four hours of travel.

### Base Travel Rates (Per Hour)

|Method of Travel|Road|Overland|Mountain|
|--- |--- |--- |--- |
|Dogsled *|2 miles|1 mile|1/2 mile|
|Axe Beak|1 mile|1 mile|1/2 mile|
|On foot, with snowshoes|1 mile|1/2 mile|1/4 mile|
|On foot, without snowshoes|1 mile|1/4 mile|1/8 mile|
{: .table .table-striped .table-hover .data-table }

<figcaption class="figure-caption mb-4">* must rest after one hour of pulling.</figcaption>

### Winter Survival Gear

In this remix Winter Survival Gear provides advantage on any checks or saves related to cold weather conditions. Being wet negates the benefit of this equipment, as well as imparts any other effects.

## Sacrifices to Auril

Shortly after Auril&#8217;s Reign of Terror began, a ferocious blizzard would descend on the Ten-Towns every new moon. The storm would bury the settlements under massive snowfalls, damage buildings, and people would lose their life during the ordeal. Ultimately these storms began to create temporary <a href="https://optionalrule.com/2021/01/04/rotf-remix-heart-of-winter-supernatural-regions/" data-type="post" data-id="185">Heart of Winter Magical Regions</a> in and around the towns, causing a great panic among the citizens. With the help of shamen from the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Reghedmen" target="_blank">Reghed Nomads</a> and spirit talkers from the towns, The Speakers Counsel began the sacrifices to appease Auril and prevent the vicious storms. The sacrifices began 7 months prior to the campaign and so far the sacrifices have proved successful in preventing the storms, but as time wears on tension grows that a town will fail to meet its obligation and the storms will return.

Humanoid Sacrifices are conducted different in each town as follows:

  * **Bryn Shander:** Each month, a person has stepped forward to volunteer as sacrifice, usually from the elderly or the sick. To honor those that sacrifice, the town cares the trunk of a tall tree with icons from the volunteers life, topping each log with a carved bust of the person. These are mounted in the town square, at the base of each a growing set of small offerings accumulate. Sacrifices are sent without weapon, adequate clothing, or supplies out onto the tundra.
  * **Easthaven:** Each month the town sacrifices a criminal. This has led the town to take a strict and proactive approach to law enforcement. Sacrifices are drown in the nearby lake through a hole in the ice.
  * **Targos:** The town is the only one to conduct a lottery, which it touts as &#8220;fair and impartial to all citizens&#8221;. It is known to be rife with corruption. Each citizen is required to enter up to 4 lots depending on their age, with younger citizens entering less and minors exempt. Citizens are allowed to pay a tax to remove lots from the lottery, and there are rumors that some very affluent members of the town are able to buy their way out entirely. Sacrifices are shot with arrows near the entrance to the frozen port.

title: 'Simulating Sadness: Great Weapon Fighter Damage'

description: An breakdown and analysis of the outcomes of different options related to the Great Weapon Fight feat in 5th edition.
categories:
  - Analysis

---
I have always had a bit of doubt about the overall benefit of the Great Weapon Fighter fighting style and the Improved Critical ability for Champions in 5th Edition Dungeons and Dragons, so I dig into it a bit below. 

In terms of damage, Great Weapon fighter letting you reroll a one or two seem okay, but you have to keep the result of whatever the reroll is. Not only might this not change the result but if you roll a 2 the first time, and a 1 on the reroll you&#8217;re actually doing **LESS** damage on the roll. 

{% include imageframe.html
  figure_class="float-end ms-4 clearfix"
  src="/assets/img/grog_by_nickroblesart-384x301.jpg"
  alt="A goliath barbarian leaping in the air about to strike with their axe."
  width="384" height="301"
  caption="Image Credit Nick Robles"
 %}

The ability of Champions to score a critical on a 19 or 20 sounds fine but I think this fails Fighter classes because dice are generally not where the fighters damage is and they spread that damage out across multiple attacks as they level. This means that doubling the weapon damage dice from a critical has a relatively small effect. It also means that the increased chance of a critical is limited by relatively small number of dice bound to a single attack roll.

## The Math

**Update June of 2021** Adding the math because people complain about wanting the math instead of a simulation so I'll add that here.  Based on this thread from [rpg.stackexchange](https://rpg.stackexchange.com/questions/47172/how-much-damage-does-great-weapon-fighting-add-on-average), this is a table of the difference in damage per die type with great weapon fighting.  In the criticals it's doubling the difference 5% of the time normally and 10% of the time when a champion subclass. Simulation or math the conclusions are the same in either case.

|Die Type|Difference|
|--- |:---: |
|1d4|0.50|
|1d6|0.67|
|1d8|0.75|
|1d10|0.80|
|1d12|0.83|
|2d6|1.32|
{: .table .table-striped .table-hover .data-table .table-fluid .table-responsive}

***

## The Simulation

In any case, I just wanted to have a bit of fun so I setup a small bit of code to simulate a million damage rolls and calculate the mean. Below is the resulting data from that simulation. The mean of the damage output was simulated for the **Base** weapon damage, Base Weapon Damage with a chance of critical on a **20**, and Base Weapon Damage with a chance of critical on **19** and above. I did this both for a **Normal** fighter and again for a fighter with the great weapon fighting style (**GWF**)
{: .clearfix .w-100 }

**Update June 2021** I had a typo in the data which caused a real gem of a person to launch a series of personal attacks about this. Sociopathic issues aside they wanted to see the simulation code, which is a reasonable requst.  You can find that [here](https://github.com/Streamweaver/DnDNotebook) and it should be runnable in MyBinder. This run is cranked down to 10k iterations for performance.

**Table1.** Mean damage of two-handed weapons ***without*** Great Weapon Fighting (**Normal**)

|Weapons|Damage|Base|20|19|
|--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |
|Greatclub, Quarterstaff|1d8|4.5|4.7|4.9|
|Glaive, Halberd, Longsword, Pike, Warhammer|1d10|5.5|5.8|6.0|
|Greataxe|1d12|6.5|6.9|7.1|
|Greatsword, Maul|2d6|7.0|7.4|7.6|
{: .table .table-striped .table-hover .data-table }

***

**Table 2**. Mean damage of two-handed weapons ***with*** Great Weapon Fighting (**GWF**)

|Weapons|Damage|Base|20|19|
|--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |
|Greatclub, Quarterstaff|1d8|5.2|5.5|5.8|
|Glaive, Halberd, Longsword, Pike, Warhammer|1d10|6.3|6.6|6.9|
|Greataxe|1d12|7.3|7.7|8.1|
|Greatsword, Maul|2d6|8.3|8.7|9.2|
{: .table .table-striped .table-hover .data-table }

Given the relatively small benefit of these differences, and the general disruption of flow at the table as a player manages dice that need to be rerolled, these abilities seem questionable in value to the game. Perhaps I&#8217;m missing something about the numbers but that is my take after looking at the numbers. 

## House Rules

It&#8217;s 5th edition right? so everyone&#8217;s first response is to create a fix through a house rule. I&#8217;ve seen two house rules frequently suggested, I&#8217;m not sure if people are using them or not so drop me an <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.twitter.com/optionalrule" target="_blank">@ on twitter</a> with your experiences if you do. The two house rules I&#8217;ve seen are:

  1. When you roll a 1 or 2 you can roll the die again and add the value to the previous roll. 
  2. When you roll a 1 or a 2 you can reroll the die, keeping the higher of the two die results.

So let&#8217;s take a look at the results of these rules.

**Table 3.** GWF house rule option &#8211; Adding the rerolled die to the original result

|Weapons|Damage|Base|20|19|
|--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |
|Greatclub, Quarterstaff|1d8|5.6|5.9|6.2|
|Glaive, Halberd, Longsword, Pike, Warhammer|1d10|6.6|7.0|7.3|
|Greataxe|1d12|7.6|7.9|8.3|
|Greatsword, Maul|2d6|9.3|9.8|10.3|
{: .table .table-striped .table-hover .data-table }


I&#8217;m not a huge fan of this, even though it&#8217;s a bit more powerful than the vanilla rule. Sure it provides a slight bump but it seems fairly weak tea compared to the single weapon Dueling fighting style that gets a flat +2 to damage and still gets to use a shield (you know that right?). 

***Table 4.*** GWF house rule option &#8211; GWF rerolling until you get a higher result.

|Weapons|Damage|Base|20|19|
|--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |
|Greatclub, Quarterstaff|1d8|5.2|5.5|5.8|
|Glaive, Halberd, Longsword, Pike, Warhammer|1d10|6.3|6.6|7.0|
|Greataxe|1d12|7.4|7.7|8.0|
|Greatsword, Maul|2d6|8.4|8.8|9.3|
{: .table .table-striped .table-hover .data-table }
  
I&#8217;m even less a fan of this rule. I honestly can&#8217;t believe people do this but I hear about it enough to think I should include it. The interruption of a player examining the outcome of each of their die rolls, rerolling and examining that, and rerolling again, seems not worth the interruption to combat turns. It makes very little comparative difference for the effort, and it only even seems a bit useful in the context of a Champion, which I would recommend become a subclass feature if I thought the rule worthwhile at all.

## Swing and a Missed Opportunity

Overall I feel like Great Weapon Fighter was a missed opportunity in 5th edition. A weak damage bonus is a counter to the notion of powerful attacks the fighting style evokes. I think this is falling victim to the notion that Battlemaster has to have all the combat maneuvers and would much rather have seen Great Weapon Fighter dominate the battlefield with abilities that pointed to power or burst damage. A fix would go beyond the complexity of a simple house rule, but I&#8217;d have preferred to see something like cleve options, knocking opponents down, or even something out of the box like a times per long rest damage add similar to a Paladin&#8217;s smite (Paladin&#8217;s still retain the upper hand since theirs overcomes damage resistance in many cases).

Regardless, I&#8217;d like to hear what you think or how you handle it so hit me up and let me know.

I will write a whole post someday on the importance of friendship in Tabletop Roleplaying groups. Today though I want to capture two tweets I made because I don&#8217;t think you can ever say this enough. 

<div class="row row-cols-auto">

<div class="col">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DnD?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#DnD</a> tip: Play groups should work to be friends. Being part of an RPG group makes you are very vulnerable. Doing voices, expressing emotion, or just asking someone to do something cool with you makes you vulnerable.</p>&mdash; Optional Rule (@optionalrule) <a href="https://twitter.com/optionalrule/status/1347642826612473859?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 8, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Most poor DM behavior is compensating for that.</p>&mdash; Optional Rule (@optionalrule) <a href="https://twitter.com/optionalrule/status/1347643094943019010?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 8, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

</div>

That&#8217;s it. Try to be friends with each other is the best advice I can give any gaming group. Learn a bit about each other and learn to enjoy each other&#8217;s company for a bit. You don&#8217;t have to be the best of friends. You don&#8217;t have to be up in each others lives, which can even be unhealthy. However, you&#8217;re going to be spending a few hours together every week, being vulnerable in your roleplaying, and hanging your hopes for a fun time on every other person in the game. 

Do more than just try to be friendly and polite with one another, though that is critical too. Make an effort to try to be friends. Show up early to talk, or hangout a little after and bond over the game. Take some time to see the person and not the character or dungeon master. Offer up a bit of yourself to others so they can get to know you too. Above all, try to understand your new friends. You&#8217;ll get more out of this as a group than almost anything else I can think of.

This is an NPC I've used in my Rime of the Frostmaiden campaign as a foil in Bryn Shander and to introduce a political ingrique plot for the players early on in the game. 

**Description:** A finely dressed tall thin human with hawkish features and tightly bound raven hair and high widows peaks. His angular features seem to have frozen his face into a permanent scowl. His skin is flawless and his amber eyes scan people very quickly.

{% include imageframe.html

  alt="A well dressed man with pale skin, high widows peaks, and a look of cool disdain."

  caption="Image Credit Wizards of the Coast"
 %}


**Personality:** He believes people are spoiled and unwilling to work. That they are made lazy by the march of civilization and that only what he considers hard working people deserve any sort of benefit. He has a taste for the finer things and spends a great deal of money on luxuries, some more exotic than others.

**History:** Gifted from a young age, Arnold studied in Waterdeep where he earned a reputation for profiting by taking advantage of workers. His family was turned out during political infighting and a failed attempt to seize wealth in hopes of becoming a part of the Masked Lords. He and his family returned north, where his grandparents originated and took direct control of salvage and recovery interests. He has built up a small fortune and can afford his own way.

**Motivation:** To form a more stable political alignment with the rich and powerful of the area.

**Occupation:** Artifacts, salvage, criminal enterprises.

**Voice:** Half-singing

**Plot:** Arnold is a member of [The Chardalyn Syndicate]({% link _posts/2021-01-04-rotf-remix-the-far-north-ten-towns.md %}), controllling Bryn Shander.  After a failed election to town speaker he has energetically pursued every opportunity to undermine the current town speaker.  He is also working with a local band of goblins to intercept or disrupt the supply lines for rival businesses in town.  His goal is to spark a revolt that installs him as town speaker.

This is my remix of the Foaming Mugs quest from the 5th edition Dungeons and Dragons module, <a href="https://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/icewind-dale-rime-frostmaiden" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden</a>. You can use this to spice up your encounter with a bit more intrigue, potential negotiation and roleplay. It also ties back to The Chardalyn Syndicate, a faction that is part of the [Far North & Ten-Towns][1] remix posted here previously. Check out the [RotF][2] and Remix tags on this site for more remixes.

I avoid reproducing items from the module and you&#8217;ll need the original to make sense of this but be aware this **may imply spoilers**.

## What this remix changes 

  * Turns this into an &#8220;inside job&#8221; involving one of the dwarves.
  * Adds a fantastic location for the encounter to play out in.
  * Throws in a possible Yeti encounter.
  * Introduces a &#8216;secret&#8217; ending for investigative players who catch onto the inside job.

## Overview 

The lost shipment of iron was an inside job. Korux the Dwarf is working with Izobai the goblin leader to steal the shipment on behalf of Arnold Beitz, who they know will pay for goods that get lost on the road. Conspiring together, Korux and Izobai made a plan to scare off the dwarves using Izobai&#8217;s polar bears. Korux convinced the other dwarves to travel overland using one of his old smuggling routes because the roads were unsafe. Izobai decided it wasn&#8217;t worth risking his polar bears and bought a small charm that attracts Yeti. Unfortunately, for all involved the Yeti didn&#8217;t announce its presence, ambushed the dwarves, gravely wounding Korux in the process. Since then, Izobai and the goblins have been waiting for the Yeti to clear out before recovering the shipment.

**The core of the adventure is as follows:**

  * Get the quest from the dwarves to recover the iron shipment. _Potential RP & Foreshadowing_.
  * Travel to the site of the lost shipment, find the Yeti charm, and perhaps realize something more is happening. _Potential environmental encounter_.
  * Follow the trail of the shipment to find the Goblins trying to make off with it. _Potential negotiation or slapstick fighting_.
  * Encounter the Yeti still in the area. _Potential difficult fight_.
  * Discover the &#8216;hidden&#8217; encounter, where Arnold Beitz attempts to have Korux killed for his incompetence. _Potential intrigue, fight, or roleplaying_. 

## Getting The Quest 

**What&#8217;s at stake:** This is a roleplaying encounter, it sets up the quest, foreshadows the forthcoming action. 

Players get the quest much the same as it does in the module. In addition to the boxed description in the encounter, read the following.

<div class="card blockquote blockquote-caption fst-italic p-3">"Toward the back of the group, the Dwarf introduced as Korux is cradling a heavily wounded and bandaged hand.  He seems sullen and withdrawn"</div>

Ironically, Korux was the most severely wounded member of his group in the Yeti attack. This causes the other dwarves to tease him for having suggested the possible safe route. DMs should use this encounter as foreshadowing rather than revealing anything. There&#8217;s really not much here to reveal, Korux doesn&#8217;t know Izobai betrayed him and caused the Yeti attack. 

If the players agree to recover the iron shipment the dwarves will tell them where they can find it.

<div class="card blockquote blockquote-caption fst-italic p-3">"The roads have been a dangerous place for honest folk since the long winters night fell.   Damn me for saying yes, but that damn fool Korux talked me into takin' an old smuggling route of his.  It's through a cursed place folks call The Dancers Garden.  Cursed place that is, poor folks turned to stone when a medusa attacked a long time ago."</div>

The dwarves will say the Yeti came out of nowhere, killed Oobok, and wounded Korux when he tried to intervene. They all ran shortly afterwards and made their way back to Bryn Shander. Importing the players to help, if they sense the players to be kind hearted at all, they will add.

<div class="card blockquote blockquote-caption fst-italic p-3">"The iron was bound for Blackiron Blades an they'll be in a world o'hurt if ya can't recover it.  They owe a might o'money and the clan sent the shipment to keep them afloat for a bit more.  I know Hruna wouldn't forget a kind turn like this."</div>

If the players get it into their head to shake down Blackiron Blades, they&#8217;ll be disappointed. The store is poor and has little to offer other than a free blade or two, free repairs, and ernest thanks.

## On the Trail of the Lost Shipment 

Players approach this section much as they do in the &#8220;Search for the Sled&#8221; section of the module. The following additions or changes apply.

### Fantastic Location: The Dancers Garden

 %}

**What&#8217;s at stake:** This is a lore and investigation encounter. It mostly sets the players up to know what to be aware of and how to approach the follow-on encounters.

The lost sled with the iron shipment is six miles west north-west of Bryn Shander. Locals call this area The Dancers Garden. Fifty years ago, it was the sight of a small gnomish village that became the target of a Medusa&#8217;s wraith. The area is a littered jumble of broken structures dotted with the petrified remains of the villagers. The stone remains of the Medusa&#8217;s victims are scattered around, in macabre poses with expressions of surprise and terror. Most locals avoid the area. 

If DMs may want to use the [Heart of Winter Magical Region][3] I created. This makes an excellent location to use and introduce the players to terrors in the north. Note, you will likely want to scale down some of the effects of the region as appropriate for the party. 

### Oobok&#8217;s Remains 

In addition to the information from the module. The players find a small charm nearby, on a long stick driven into the snow. On top of the stick, they discover a charm made of holly branches and yeti fur. 

#### Building a Mystery 

DMs should give out the minimal information needed for players to understand something is going on. Save value added information for follow-up actions and skills. On finding the charm, **pass this minimum information to the players**. _The charm itself looks recently made and obviously placed in this path._ 

If the players the charm or the area, they may also discover:

  * A DC 10 Arcana (Intelligence) will let them realize the charm is a folk magic fetish used to attract Yeti. 
  * A DC 10 History (Intelligence) check will reveal the charm seems to be of local goblin make. Make this roll at disadvantage if not from the region.
  * A DC 15 Survival (Wisdom) check will reveal Yeti tracks no older than four hours in the area. (The Yeti is still around)

Note this is in addition to the tracks and other information found about the sled being taken away. The players notice the tracks left by the sled and direction but leave other information for skill rolls and investigation. This might include information about the number of people, how heavily armored, and more.

### The Goblin Encounter 

**What&#8217;s at stake:** This is primarily a roleplaying encounter. There&#8217;s the possibility it will turn into a physical contest if they get into tug of war over the sled. The Goblins have no desire to fight but will defend themselves if need be. 

{% include imageframe.html
  figure_class="float-start me-4"
  src="https://i.redd.it/374qnc6laz961.jpg"

  height="480" width="480"
  caption="Winter landscape battlemap"
 %}
[link to fullsize map](https://i.redd.it/374qnc6laz961.jpg)

This encounter plays out much as it does in the book. The players find the goblins making off with the sled. The goblins are not fighters and have no desire to fight. They will argue, claim salvage, lie, cheat, or take advantage of anything they can to get the players to leave. At most they will wrestle or have a tug of war over the sled. If the players gain control of the cart, they will scream &#8216;Fine, we didn&#8217;t want it anyway&#8221; and blow a large horn summoning any other goblins before they leave. They will fight as a last resort if cornered or trapped. Izobai will leave his crew behind and fire crossbows from the cart as it pulls away, 

Any significant amount of noise will start The Yeti Attack encounter.

When the Yeti attacks the goblins will be as surprised as the players. They will panic and run around, the wagon will begin to pull away, leaving any goblins by the sled behind.

**_What the Goblins Know:_** The goblin boss is the only one with any real information about the full plot. All the Goblins know is they were told by the boss. They were going to recover something, they&#8217;ve been sitting out here a few days and went to get the shipment several hours prior to the players arriving. If for some reason the players are able to force a convince Izobai to talk, he will be evasive and not reveal any information voluntarily. The most he will reveal is that he knows of a salvage operation in Bryn Shander that pays for recovered goods without any questions. He will also say he learned of the shipment by hearing dwarves talk about it back at a trading post. Technically not a lie, Korux told him about it. Only under the direst circumstances will Izobai reveal Korux&#8217;s involvement. Izobai also knows they were to deliver the shipment at a meeting place in a back alley in Bryn Shander a day from whenever this encounter takes place. See the &#8220;hidden&#8221; encounter below called **Lose Ends**.

### The Yeti Attack 

**What&#8217;s at stake:** Survival! The yeti wants more food and to dominate its territory. If the goblins help it may be a chance to renegotiate afterwards.

The Yeti has remained in the area the last few days, drawn by the charm and is seeking to establish a new lair. The <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/yeti" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yeti</a> encounter is straightforward, it will roar and emerge from the darkness. Roll the Yeti&#8217;s stealth check and compare it to the players passive perception to determine if they are surprised.

A note on balancing the encounter. This is an early encounter (I ran it against a level 1 party) and may be more or less difficult depending the party state and composition. Some tweaks you can consider to rebalance the encounter **up** or **down**.

  * **Up**, have a Yeti Tyke accompany the Yeti.
  * **Up**, bump the Yeti&#8217;s hit points (if you know the average damage output of the party give it about 3 rounds)
  * **Down**, limit it&#8217;s use of Chilling Gaze or don&#8217;t have it use it altogether (say the blizzard keeps it from using the gaze or it&#8217;s lost an eye)
  * **Down**, have the goblins join in the fight if it starts going south. They don&#8217;t want the thing chasing them. This might spark a parlay or more roleplay with the goblins.

Note Yeti are fearless but it will flee it below 10 hp.

## Returning the Goods 

**What&#8217;s at stake:** This is mostly a roleplaying encounter and possible investigation encounter if the players uncover Korux&#8217;s involvement.

Returning the goods happens much as it does in the module. Korux has healed a bit but is still sullen and withdrawn. The DM will need to adapt to the next steps as best they see fit but the broad possible outcome

  * If the players share details about the charm or reveal any information that does not directly name Korux, he will continue his sullen behavior but give no indicator of any other information. 
  * Information about this being an inside job will cause the dwarves will begin to argue among themselves and eventually ask the players to leave as this is &#8220;a family discussion.&#8221;
  * Directly accusing Korux of involvement will cause him to vehemently deny it, and start an argument among the dwarves similar to the previous bullet. Ultimately if pushed far enough Korux will confess and throw himself on the mercy of his friends who will again ask the players to leave.

## Loose Ends 

**What&#8217;s at stake:** This can range anywhere from a roleplaying to a combat encounter depending on how the players run it. This is also a &#8220;hidden&#8221; encounter in that it will only take place if the players are pro-active and follow-up on details from the previous encounters.

The handoff of the goods to Arnold Beitz and his gang is supposed to happen a day or so after the party returns to Bryn Shander. It will happen in some out of the way alley late at night when there are not many potential observers. Korux will sneak out from wherever he and his friends are staying, he dares not ignore the meeting.

The alley way the meeting happens in will only have a single entrance. Arnold will meet with Izobai and Korux and demand an answer to their failure to deliver. He will express his extreme disappointment in their failure and make very vague threats that this sort of incompetence cannot be tolerated.

The setup of the scene:

  * Two [Thugs][4] guard the entrance to the back alley, keeping out anyone attempting to get in. They are inattentive and resentful of the cold.
  * [Arnold Beitz][5] is standing in the deep shadows of the alley way. He has five <a href="https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Bandit#content" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bandits</a> attending him, two <a href="https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Thug#content" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Thugs</a> as body guards, and one <a href="https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Bandit%20Captain#content" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bandit Captain</a>. 

There are many outcomes depending on how the players approach this encounter, if they approach it at all. Note, DMs should make apparent the forces in the alley could not be overcome, overthrowing a local crime boss is generally beyond the capability of a 1st level party. This should be made obvious.

  * If confronted or disrupted, Arnold Beitz will simply say &#8220;take care of it&#8221; and retreat into a building, escaping with the help of other allies. The remaining thugs will insist the players leave, telling them they didn&#8217;t see anything. The bandits and thugs will attack if pushed. If the players are defeated, they will be left outside the walls of the city, presumably to die in the cold.
  * If the players are able to observe the exchange, Arnold will berate Izobai and Korux for their failure and his resentment for having to be out in this weather to address it. He will eventually focus his disappointment on Korux, stating that at least Izobai has been of service before. Eventually everyone will be dismissed, Izobai and Korux will depart in different directions. A few moments after things break up, two Thugs follow Korux at a distance and will attempt to kill him in some remote street as he sulks back to whenever he is staying.

If players do not discover this encounter or do nothing, two days after they return, they will hear news that the Dwarf Korux was found dead in the streets having been stabbed in the back.

## Wrapping Things Up 

So that&#8217;s it. This adventure can be a self-contained encounter and left there. In my own campaign I used this as a tease for the intrigue I introduced involving the attempt by The Chardlyn Syndicate to control the Ten-Towns. DMs can use this as a means to introduce that or some other plot element into the game.

Here are my thoughts on how I can use content from <a href="https://shop.mcdmproductions.com/products/arcadia-issue1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arcadia</a> in my 5th edition Dungeons and Dragons game. Arcadia is a new magazine style digital publication for 5e in the tradition of the old Dragon Magazine. In particular, the content is a useful buffet of [DM resources](/category/rpg-resources/), [adventures](/category/encounters/), and lore that enhances existing games. 

{% include imageframe.html

  alt="A harpy against a dense woodland."
  height="518" width="400"
  caption="Arcadia Issue 1 Cover by MCDM"
 %}

Arcadia is a solid debut and I think I can get use out of everything in it. Of course, I think most groups would find it useful as well. You can get it for <a href="https://shop.mcdmproductions.com/products/arcadia-issue1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$7 per issue on the MCDM shop</a>, or as a <a href="https://www.patreon.com/mcdm/posts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$5 and above patreon</a>. 

**No** <em style="font-weight: bold;">spoilers</em> here. I stick to what I thought was useful in the issue and why.

## Things I Found Particularly Useful 

The layout was well done and easy to read, and the way the content is organized will make it easy to reference during a session. Obviously the utility of a printable PDF is a strength here, I can print handouts, or copy/paste as needed. I enjoyed the art style, not only is it evocative, but it&#8217;s different and always useful I can show during a game. Additionally, I very much appreciate they included both DM and player version of maps for my <a href="https://foundryvtt.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Virtual Table Top</a>. Also, I found the length very useful at 43 pages. Meaning long enough to make for solid sit-down and enjoy it time, but not so long that it stays in my reading backlog. 

### The Workshop Watches 

**The Workshop Watches** is a fun short encounter you can drop into any campaign and probably run in a single night. The tone and style is going to be different from many games, which is what I look for in a published adventure. The McGuffin of the adventure is creative and doesn&#8217;t assume a party motivation, making it flexible. The location is intellectually interesting enough to give the party something to RP about. However, it&#8217;s not so lore heavy that the party can&#8217;t grasp it in a single session. Adding to the utility of the art I mentioned above, the handouts for this adventure add tangible assets I can use to root players in the world. Lastly, the central antagonists acquires spells in an interesting way that can make the playthrough unique each time. 

### The Titan Heart 

**The Titan Heart** subclass is an interesting expansion for sorcerers with unique abilities and a great theme. It seems well balanced against other sub-classes and doesn&#8217;t suffer from power creep. Since the abilities are unique, the player should always feel like they have their own role. Equally important, the aspects related to lore and implied setting should be easy to fit into most campaigns. Additionally, it comes with a handful of well crafted 1st level spells and a CR 7 NPC that can be used independently. Most of all all, this is a subclass I would be interested in playing myself or having someone play at my table.

### Jumping on Mounted Combat 

**Jumping on Mounted Combat** adds some easy and interesting to spice up encounters. The rules themselves mesh well with existing 5e rules and wont create a new set of record keeping and they easy to understand. Without a doubt, I&#8217;ll have to give a bit more thought as to how this interact with other rules. Given that 5th edition has tightly coupled rules, a change to one area might have unintended impact in another. Primarily what jumps out at me to think about, is how this might interact or contrast with the new Beastmaster companions rules. Additionally, I need to think a bit more about how this might blend with the sidekick rules form Tasha&#8217;s. Regardless, thinking about new rules alone always adds to my game and I find it useful, even if I need to sit with it a bit. 

Rules aside, the mounted combat section also includes a hand full of creative and useful mounts you can add to your game. Even if I choose not to use the mounted combat rules, I&#8217;d find the mounts useful as monster encounters. 

Lastly, there&#8217;s a whole encounter added that showcases these rules and new mounts that can be dropped into any adventure. I mean, how cool is that! Great festival style encounters is something lacking in 5e adventures. 

### Uqaviel The Recreant 

**Uqaviel the Recreant** adds interesting lore and powerful celestials for higher tier play. In spite of the heavy impact of celestial lore on an implied setting, I thought this would be easy to integrate. The beings are evocative, unique and flavorful without forcing much of a particular point of view on the divine. Best of all, these are new and unique celestials instead of a retread of real world myths or overused <a href="https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Asmodeus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Princes of Hell</a>. In short, if I found myself needing a quick celestial in the middle of a game, I felt like I could reach for one of these and drop them in. That&#8217;s a bit win for me as a DM.

## Things That Would Make it More Useful 

Generally speaking, I don&#8217;t have a lot to say here as I can use almost everything in the issue.

It would have made it more useful if I knew what type of article I was reading from the start of the article itself. The table of contents lists the article title and a sentence about what it is, but the article itself starts with some prose and doesn&#8217;t tell you up front. Given the way I read the issue on laptop or tablet, this created some confusion for me as I scroll past the TOC to browse the articles. Unless I scrolled back up to the TOC it would take me a moment to understand what I&#8217;m reading is supposed to be about. 

The last thing I&#8217;ll mention is that I found myself slightly stressed about how I&#8217;ll use this across digital toolsets. Since we&#8217;ve all become fragmented across multiple platforms, this is going to be a persistent issue with any gaming content. Things like the mounted combat rules have no barrier at all. Adventures will be fairly transferable with just some cutting and pasting. Alternatively, custom monsters will require a bit of data entry, and subclasses present the most challenging transferrable content. This is a consequence of our gaming environment, not of published content in things like Arcadia. However, it&#8217;s something we&#8217;re all going to have to think about as the RPG landscape and tools continue to evolve.

## _I Do Not Do Reviews Disclaimer_ 

I do not do reviews. The only important factor to me is if something is usable in a real game. That&#8217;s it. Firstly, I am not a judge of product quality, look at my own writing afterall. Secondly, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s useful to break things down to their minute detail to critically dissect elements in some failed attempted at High Gaming Culture. With this in mind, you can expect comments from me on how you might use something too. If you need a hot-take, this is probably not the content for you.

title: Level Up Your Game with these RPGs

categories:

Learning different RPG systems is the most useful thing a DM or player can do to up their game. Doing so teaches you all sorts of ways to approach narration, mood, play, resolutions, and any number of other skills that could be useful in a game. 

Last week I <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/optionalrule/status/1350078271443132416" target="_blank">tweeted a question</a> the question below.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">What system besides <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DnD?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#DnD</a> do you recommend people learn to open their mind to the possibilities of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TTRPGs?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#TTRPGs</a>?</p>&mdash; Optional Rule (@optionalrule) <a href="https://twitter.com/optionalrule/status/1350078271443132416?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 15, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

In the end, I had over 80 replies and quoted retweets, which is fairly large for me. Unsurprisingly, I found the recommendations to be solid and thoughtful. To start, many of the systems would be ones I would have recommended myself. In addition, there&#8217;s a healthy list of games that are new to me. After looking them up, I felt like I discovered some great new sources to expand my own thinking. Therefore, I decided to aggregate the replies as best I could and show the results here.

The answers people provided alone said a lot about how they think about games. For instance, people mentioned Powered by the Apocalypse most of the time, but also named either Apocalypse World or Dungeon World individually. Many people mentioned Fate but few named a specific Fate based system. 

What an amazing set of answers, everything on this list can teach you something new to add to your gaming experience. Some systems do a lot to teach about pacing, mood, and mystery. While other games have interesting takes on mechanics it can&#8217;t help but make you think differently about resolving checks. 

I&#8217;ll leave this list here on hopes you pick up a suggestion you haven&#8217;t tried before.

title: Create Captivating Traps
author: Scott Turnbull
layout: post

description: How to make traps fun and exciting in 5th edition games.
categories:
  - RPG Resources

People are stuck in a lot of bad thinking when it comes to how to use <a href="https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/traps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">traps in 5th edition</a> Dungeons and Dragons. Traditionally, people see traps as a way to use resources by dispensing some damage along the way. Largely, this falls flat in a 5th edition game where resting lets you recover quickly. Worse, randomly placed traps can come off as spiteful or thrown in just to annoy the players. So, if you want to make traps a more exciting part of an encounter, create traps that [drive things forward]({% link _posts/2021-01-03-progressive-failures-and-rising-tension-in-5th-edition.md %}) rather than simple binary events. 

<blockquote class="blockquote">
 The best way to come up with an excellent trap is to ask yourself, &#8220;<strong>why does this trap exist?</strong>&#8220;
</blockquote>

## Why Do Traps Exist? 

{% include imageframe.html
  figure_class="float-end mx-4"
  src="/assets/img/indy_480x320.jpg"
  alt="An archeologist abouit to take a gold statue from a pedistal."
  height="320" width="480"
  caption="Image credit Disney Films"
 %}

Before adding anything to an encounter, ask yourself _&#8220;what do I want out of this?&#8221;_. Things don&#8217;t randomly exist in any encounter, you created it for a purpose. Perhaps, you might be moving the plot forward, or foreshadowing an interesting development. You might be adding them as a change of pace, leading the players to ask &#8220;why does this exist&#8221; and roleplaying it out. Alternatively, you might add a trap to make a combat more dynamic and trilling.

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
  <p>
    <strong>A good trap advances the plot or enhances the action</strong>… <em>A great trap does both!</em>
  </p>
</blockquote>

That is to say, it shouldn&#8217;t be a mild annoyance or just use up resources, that comes off as cheap to players. Think of a trap like an exclamation mark highlighting the plot, or a comma describing the action of a combat.

## Advancing the Plot {#h-advancing-the-plot}

Traps are a great way to imply information to the players, or just directly tell them something. It can say something about the resources or thinking of the enemy. They can be a pointer to let players know there&#8217;s something important here. Additionally, traps can setup distractions and make the players feel like they are in a battle of wits with the bad guys. 

Some examples of using traps to further the plot:

  * Players are investigating a simple manor with a magical trap doing necromantic damage. Making them wonder how did the owner get access to such magics?
  * A trapped pathway is triggered against whoever might be coming the other way. This suggests something they&#8217;re is trying to be kept from getting out. 
  * A trap using a special poison might tie back to a local thieves&#8217; guild. Alternatively, a clockwork contraption back to the local artificer&#8217;s guild. Leading the players to the next stage of their investigation into a mystery.
  * A trap on a seemingly normal segment of wall in an otherwise unremarkable location. This results in discovering a hidden plot device or secret that moves the party forward in the plot.
  * Traps that cause an effect like sleep, incapacitation, or some other non-damaging effect. Indicates they may be facing a foe that could be negotiated with.

These examples shift the focus of a trap from a damage delivery mechanism to a plot mechanism. This lets you communicate something to the players and spending time with the clue gives them something to debate. In these cases, traps do their job without doing damage or effecting the players in any way. There&#8217;s an argument to be made that DMs should consider letting players find them automatically. Afterall, important plot information should be obvious. 

## Advancing The Action 

My favored way to use traps is to enhance the action of a game session. To do so, we need to create a trap that either presents a complex skill challenge itself, or complicates combat in an interesting way. In other words, traps are as much a part of the environment or encounter as any other element in the world. Given that, think of an integrating a trap into a scene when you find yourself asking yourself you could spice things up. 

### Skill Challenge Traps

Traps that present skill challenges usually modify the environment in some way that needs the players to generate ideas and skills. Similar to 4th edition Skill Challenges, the DM should imagine a series of thing that a trap might trigger and what skills players might use. For example, a simple pit trap that drops a player into water with a lid that slams shut over them. The player in the trap may need to roll Athletics to reach air pockets and stay afloat, particularly if they have equipment. Additionally, they may need perception to locate a disabling mechanism and a Dex check to work it. Characters above may try an object attack to break the hatch or more. 

In the example above we&#8217;re talking about a simple trap but you can hopefully see how the trap is just a setup for a situation that engages the players rather than just delivering hit points. Some other examples that might create complex environments that require skill or attribute rolls are listed below as well.

  * A hallway of spinning blades players must dodge to reach the disable mechanism.
  * An environmental challenge like falling ice from a ceiling, requiring characters to roll DEX to navigate without causing them to fall.
  * A series of charged plates that deliver a shock requiring the players to probe the location and discovery the navigable path forward or find another way around.
  * A poison trap that causes damage over time to a character, requiring medical rolls, or herbalism kit checks to manage.

In all of these cases, it helps if you think of traps more as environmental challenges and how they can add tension to the narrative. 

## Combat Complications

Traps work particularly well as mechanisms to enhance or complicate combats. Notably, they add some element of additional danger, time pressure, or dimension to engage skills. With this in mind, DMs can add traps as a way to trigger combat or add an extra effect to combat that enhances the danger in a fun way. 

Understanding that traps are mostly defensive in nature, many examples will put the players at a disadvantage. Together with the physical foes the players might face, the DM should be calculating all of these elements together to balance any given scenario.

  * A pit trap with slamming lid at a place someone might try to sneak past a guard post.
  * A trapped bridge that dumps characters into water while archers fire from the other side. 
  * A series of caltrops hidden in deep grass, protecting archers in an ambush. The tall grass making for difficult terrain while the caltrops might do some damage or halt movement. 
  * Pressure plates might trigger arrows or falling objects. This gives enemies a reason to position in hopes the players will trigger these devices.
  * A trapdoor in the ceiling might see goblins coming through it alerted to add to a fight the players are trying to manage. While not a traditional &#8216;trap&#8217; the mechanism is the same. A mechanical complication the players have to manage in a way that ratchets up the tension.

## Setting Difficulties and Effects

The Dungeon Masters Guide has an excellent guide to Trap Save DCs and Attack Bonuses which is great. However, instead of a flat setback to deadly scale, I like to map DCs and bonuses to player level as well. So I prefer to use CR as a rough guide instead. This means, my trap DCs, Attack Bonus, and damage map smoothly to like so:

  * Damage is CR d10.
  * Attack bonus is 2 + 1/2 CR.
  * Save DC is 10 + 1/2 CR.

The key here is to pick something that enhances encounters, the story, or combat in a way that is interesting without adding much overhead. The simple difficulty guideline should allow you to do that without overbalancing.

## In Conclusion {#h-in-conclusion}

Returning to the original point, traps can be so much more than arbitrary ways to distribute hit points. Coupled with an interesting base encounter, traps can be an excellent way to dial up the tension or engage the players more. Expressly, traps can be thought of more as an environmental challenge than a simple event. Sitting back and asking yourself what you want out of this trap, asking why someone would want to put a trap in a location, and how it can add to the encounter is a quick and simple way to setup a great trap.

title: Summary of 5e Alchemy Rules
author: Scott Turnbull
layout: post
image: /assets/img/alchemylab-480x384.jpg
description: Summarizing the alchemy and potion creation rules from across various 5th edition books for my players.
categories:
  - RPG Resources

---

These rules are a summary of the 5e Dungeons and Dragons Alchemy and potion creation rules. These revised rules for [Crafting Magic Items][1] are presented in [Xanathar&#8217;s Guide to Everything][2], modified as per the creation of expendable items. Note that those rules replace the Item Creation Rules presented in the Dungeon Masters Guide. Additionally, this summary includes modifications made for the _Alchemist_ specialty under the [Artificer][3] class.

## Arcane Potions

Creating these potions involve skillfully mixing of special ingredients, and imbuing them with powerful magic to achieve the desired effect. Recipes for alchemical potions must be obtained or researched before they can be made and Alchemists typically carry a tome of potions they have acquired the recipes for.

#### Table 1. Potion Creation

|Rarity|Cost (gp)|Weeks|
|--- |--- |--- |
|Common|25|0.5|
|Uncommon|100|1|
|Rare|1,000|5|
|Very rare|10,000|12.5|
|Legendary|50,000|25|
{: .table .table-striped .table-hover .data-table}

#### Table 2. Alchemist Creations 

|Rarity|Cost (gp)|Days|
|--- |--- |--- |
|Common|12.5|1|
|Uncommon|50|2|
|Rare|500|9|
|Very rare|5,000|22|
|Legendary|25,000|44|
{: .table .table-striped .table-hover .data-table}

## Mundane Potions

There are a number of basic items that can be created with the simplest alchemy skills. These generally do not involve imbuing potions with magical or mystic properties. They follow simpler and less expensive guidelines for creation detailed below.

#### Table 3. Simple Creations (Alchemy Kit)

|Item|Creation Cost|Days|
|--- |--- |--- |
|Acid (vial)|12.5 gp|0.5|
|Alchemist’s Fire (flask)|25 gp|1|
|Gunpowder (horn)|17.5 gp|0.5|
{: .table .table-striped .table-hover .data-table}

#### Table 4. Simple Creations (Alchemist Sub-class) 

|Item|Creation Cost|Days|
|--- |--- |--- |
|Acid (vial)|7.25 gp|0.25|
|Alchemist’s Fire (flask)|12.5 gp|0.5|
|Gunpowder (horn)|8.75 gp|0.25|
{: .table .table-striped .table-hover .data-table }

The cost to create any of these is half the listed price (a quarter for Artificer Alchemists), and usually take a day to produce (4 per day for Artificer Alchemists).

## Foraging & Harvesting Ingredients

  figure_class="float-end mx-4"
  src="/assets/img/alchemylab-480x384.jpg"
  alt="A rustic alchemy lab."
  height="384" width="480"
 %}


I use the following **_house rules_** for players interested in harvesting and foraging ingredients to make potions. These are at at the DMs discretion and should be discussed with the group before implementing. The rules are intended to be simple and fast, and leave it to the DM and player to work out description and flavor.

Some rare herbs, roots, or other flora may provide ingredients for Mundane or Arcane potions. Characters proficient with the Herbalist or Alchemist kit may attempt a DC 15 Intelligence (Nature) check after spending 4 hours foraging. On a success they gather 1d6 GP worth of ingredients. This roll is made with advantage in rich or pristine wilderness, or disadvantage in sparse or depleted areas.

Additionally, characters proficient with Herbalist or Alchemist kit may attempt to harvest alchemical ingredients from some mythic creatures. If allowed, a player may roll a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check to harvest 1d10 gp of alchemical ingredients per creature CR rating. Creatures lower than CR 1 may optionally produce 1 gp of ingredients. These ingredients may be of general use or useful for only specific kinds of effects at the DMs discretion.

title: Managing DM Anxiety
author: Scott Turnbull
layout: post
image: /assets/img/An_anxious_Dungeon_Master_480x480.jpg
description: Recommendations for how Dungeon Masters can manage their anxiety when running TTRPGs.
categories:
  - Misc

---



How to manage anxiety as a Dungeon Master (DM) in Dungeons and Dragons has got to be the most common question I see right after, &#8220;first time DM, any advice&#8221;. Naturally this makes sense, as being a DM sits at an intersection of a number of high anxiety pursuits. That is, it combines the difficulties of managing social groups, event planning, writing, as well as improvisation and performance. Additionally, you represent every enemy, obstacle, and challenge to a group of people who themselves may be feeling similar anxiety. Given this, it&#8217;s no wonder DMs ask for advice and find anxiety to be one of the major roadblocks to running a game.

Anxiety isn&#8217;t one thing, and it has a wide variety of sources and expressions. I&#8217;ve had my own lifelong struggle with anxiety, and developing a management strategy has enabled me to enjoy games more. Regardless of the source and expression of your own anxiety, finding an effective strategy that works for you might free you to enjoy DMing too. Therefore, I thought to share some of what is effective for me and hope you find something useful to inspire you to get out and run more games. 

## Marathon Training

{% include imageframe.html
  figure_class="float-end mx-4"
  src="/assets/img/An_anxious_Dungeon_Master_480x480.jpg"
  alt="A dungeon master sitting at a table with maps and dice while looking anxious."
  height="480" width="480"

 %}

I&#8217;ll start out by saying the obvious, **_I think the best strategy is to seek professional help._** Here in the US, we incorrectly think of emotional health like a trip to the emergency room. In reality, **_a good mental health professional is more like a personal trainer than an emergency room doctor._** Firstly, you are not broken and you do not need to be fixed. Secondly, life is one big marathon of anxiety, and if you&#8217;re going to run a marathon, you should have a trainer. Lastly, bringing in an outside perspective is going to give you tools you may not have developed on your own.

So, take my advice, get a professional involved and go out and run some great games. With this said, let me tell you some specific things I do that make my anxiety manageable and help me enjoy running more.

## Change the Tape in your Head

For me, anxiety will play on an endless loop in my head, regardless of what I do. This can be a negative verbal dialog, imagery, or just a vague emotion at the edge of my thoughts. Of course, I&#8217;ve tried to silence it, but turning it off just isn&#8217;t an option for me. Instead, I realize it didn&#8217;t have to be the only loop in my head and set about creating a positive dialog with myself. As a result, **_I learned to create a conversation with my anxiety, I learned I could reason with it._**

### Be your own Friend

If I found myself with undermining thoughts, I stop and ask myself a question. **_Is this true, and how do you know it&#8217;s true?_** That question alone can shift focus or bring my emotional state down. For example, some of the anxiety driven questions and responses I might develop by asking this could be:

  * Anxiety: I don&#8217;t have enough prepared for tonight! 
      * Me: I don&#8217;t seem to get through all the content in most games, why is this different?
      * Me: So, if we ended a half hour early, would anyone care?
  * Anxiety: What if they don&#8217;t like what I planned?
      * Me: They don&#8217;t seem to think about it much and just want to roll some dice and have fun.
      * Me: Even if they didn&#8217;t, we don&#8217;t usually remember those sessions and the next one is fine.

When trying to develop a dialog with yourself, my biggest advice is this. **_Think about what you would say to a friend with the same questions. Then, say that to yourself._**

### Write down your thoughts

Naming your emotions can be one of the most powerful tools in managing them. That is to say, drag those monsters out of the closet and into the light. Likely you will discover they are not so ominous and frightening. Sometimes this can be as simple as naming an emotion and saying it out loud. Likewise, writing it down can be even more powerful to realize anxiety for what it is. Specifically, that **_anxiety is a state of emotion, not a state of being._** You feel happy, you feel sad, you feel excited, you feel anxious, but it doesn&#8217;t mean you ARE any of those things. **_Write it down and externalize it to see it for what it is._**

So, grab a pen and paper and just write down any emotion you can identify. Then take a moment to look what you&#8217;ve written, and see if it doesn&#8217;t feel less intense or urgent.

### Shift your Emotional Focus

Nobody feels just one thing, but the strength of an emotion like anxiety can make us forget that. So, take some time and **_ask yourself what else you are feeling and name or write that down_**. For example, you might be feeling excited for an upcoming encounter or plot reveal. Alternatively, you might be curious to see how players are going to engage with some lore or roleplay with your NPCs. Despite how large it seems; anxiety can&#8217;t be the only emotion you feel about an upcoming session. Therefore, be purposeful about spending time with those other emotions by naming them and giving them more attention.

Doing this might help you realize that, **_although your anxiety is part of you, you are not your anxiety._**

## Get Physical

Our physical reality strongly influences our emotional reality and vice versa. Therefore, take some time to pay attention to your body as part of your anxiety management strategy. This isn&#8217;t going to be rocket science, and we all know these things for the most part. However, the challenge is developing a routine to actually do some of them. Think about using your anxiety as a tool to remind yourself to move your body and consider any of the following.

  * **Focus on your breathing.** Make sure it&#8217;s coming from your diagram and not your upper chest. Try to make your breaths deep and rhythmic. Think about using something like <a href="https://www.yogajournal.com/video/kundalini-breathing-exercise-balance-stressed-energy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kundalini Yoga breathing exercises</a>.
  * **Notice where anxiety is manifesting in your body.** I often have a spot or general area in my body I can identify as part of my anxiety. I don&#8217;t know why this works, but if I tap that area lightly with my fingertips for a few moments, it makes it better. If the area moves, I just tap the new location until I feel a bit of relief.
  * **Pinch the fleshy area between your thumb and index finger.** Again, not sure why this works but I find if I squeeze that area and release, after a few seconds, I seem to get some relief.
  * **Cut out the caffeine, avoid the alcohol.** You need to focus during a game and not be overactive. 
  * **Ten minutes of yoga or stretches.** You don&#8217;t need a half hour session, just take five or ten minutes of something to loosen you up. I find hip openers and shoulder stretches to be particularly effective before a game.
  * **Posture.** Stand tall, spread your arms and expand your chest. Rotate your hips forward and breath before or during a game.

## Use your DM Toolbox

RPG communities are full of helpful frameworks, tools and techniques to streamline how you can run a game. In fact, there are so many options that they can be sources of anxiety themselves. The right framework lets you focus on the most important aspects of your game and cut down on confusion and can be very effective in bringing your anxiety down. So, don&#8217;t let yourself get overwhelmed and take these for what they are, a buffet of tools you can pick from when you&#8217;re ready. 

**_Pick a few key things to add to your game prep at the table, and get used to those before incorporating something new._** The trick here is to cut down on your confusion and the number of things you have to spend energy managing during a game. You&#8217;ll find over time that you can add more as you get used to running. When you have time take a look at some of these frameworks and tools.

  * <a href="https://slyflourish.com/rotldm_template.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lazy DM Prep</a>, from Return of the Lazy Dungeon Master by Sly Flourish.
  * <a href="https://www.dungeonworldsrd.com/gamemastering/fronts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Fronts System</a>, I know it from Dungeon World by I think it predates that.
  * <a href="https://1d4chan.org/wiki/Five_Room_Dungeon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Five Room Dungeon</a> encounter design. 
  * Tap communities on twitter, reddit, and follow some [great blogs](/) for advice and more.
  * Follow your favorite RPG advice <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/optionalrule" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitch</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCi7AoQ6KbaZQqhdO7heKPqw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">YouTube</a> discussions and join in that conversation.
  * Listen to Matt <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/mcolville" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Colville</a>, like a lot of Matt.

**_Use about half the tools and technology you think you can comfortably manage during any session._** This way you can keep that workflow simple and leave enough of your attention to focus on the players and what&#8217;s happening at the table. 

### Ask for Help {#h-ask-for-help}

**_Table Top RPGs are a group activity and the DM is just one member of that group, albeit with a different set of responsibilities_**. So, if you find your anxiety creeping up during a session, think about asking people in the group for something specific that might help. That could be, something as simple as a few moments break to stretch or stand up. Alternatively, you might just need some help to cut down on the confusion and anxiety of game mechanics. If this is the case, then think about asking another player to take some of the load for running things like initiative, track monster HPs or something else. 

Lastly, think about just saying to the group **_&#8220;hey everyone, I&#8217;m starting to get a little anxious.&#8221;_** This can be a powerful way to let the group know what is going on and allow them to focus on being the kind of supportive play group we all hope to foster.

## Final Words and Resources {#h-final-words-and-resources}

I hope you found something in this post to help you manage your own anxiety better and run more games. I have to confess I found this hard to write because the topic is so expansive and complex. Despite that, I hope I hit on something useful for you to begin to research more on your own and I want to end by listing just a couple of resources I found useful in developing my own anxiety management strategy.

The development of safety tools has been one of the more useful advancements in Tabletop Roleplaying Games in the modern era. At their heart, these tools help groups normalize expectations, level set, and understand the range of issues a particular gaming group might experience. Firstly, these tools help people understand if a game is the right one for them. Secondly, it helps shape the conversation and understanding of how to deal with different topics in a way that honors the experiences and context of everyone at the table.

I first encountered a formalized approach to this with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.montecookgames.com/consent-in-gaming/" target="_blank">Consent in Gaming</a> by Sean K. Reynolds & Shanna Germain, which provides a lot of excellent context on the topic. It got even more attention when Wizards of the Coast addressed some of these elements in <a data-type="URL" data-id="https://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/tashas-cauldron-everything" href="https://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/tashas-cauldron-everything">Tasha&#8217;s Caldron of everything</a><a data-type="URL" data-id="https://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/tashas-cauldron-everything" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/tashas-cauldron-everything" target="_blank">,</a> which is about as mainstream as you can get in the hobby. 

The various tools let you **_uncover assumptions before the game, avoid issues when planning, and back out of uncomfortable situations during a session_**. This benefits everyone at the table, including the DM.

## Some Resources

Before I make a few short comments below, here are some resources you can use at your table.

## Put On Your Big Guy/Gal/Pal Pants

The truth is, that as much attention as the topic has gotten in the last few years, **_we have a lot of work to do as a community on advocating for emotionally intelligent games_**. The negative online reaction to even the _suggestion_ that Safety Tools could be useful is an excellent example of how far we have to go. I find this profoundly disappointing when it happens, as **_fostering a good conversation has to be our top priority._** So even if you think there are people that aren&#8217;t engaging in the topic of safety honestly, that doesn&#8217;t give you carte blanche to discard the topic. We can&#8217;t wait for the environment to be perfect before beginning to act with compassion and fostering safe and sane gaming community.

In short, even if this were true, **_even if you&#8217;re the only adult in the room, it&#8217;s still your responsibility to act like an adult._**

## Specific Advice and Tools

I&#8217;ll have to post more about this in the future, but I want to get some tools I&#8217;ve created for my own game in your hands in hopes this helps you with your games.

The reason this is so important now is that more new people are entering the hobby than ever before, and we are playing with new people in our groups all the time. Establishing clear a understanding of peoples ranges on issues is a pro-active means to avoid a world of hurt. It also helps you find the right group for your preferred genre and playstyle. There is no down-side to this.

## Set The Baseline

When I recruit for a campaign, work with a new group, introduce new members, or even introduce a new campaign to a group I know, I use a Baseline Safety & Consent list. I use this first, before I even survey the group for their own views. In this way I&#8217;m able to establish things we don&#8217;t even have to discuss because I wont be making it part of my world as a DM. It also helps me establish lines with the players they shouldn&#8217;t be planning to go past. In all honesty, I&#8217;ve had players in my game exceed my limits WAY more than I have exceeded theirs, and I am not a particularly squeamish guy. Trust me, if you are a DM, this is important for you and for your group.

By way of example, you can see the Baseline Safety & Consent slide from my most recent <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1kjaK9Q9p90P54E2ITZPf0DHGyaZZMHXYAg52Ar19zp4/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Campaign Pitch Deck</a> below. I&#8217;ll write a whole post on Pitch Decks some-day, but not to-day. Note this is a start of a conversation, not an end to one. I put these in a slide to get me to the next step of talking in depth about this with the players.<

  height="540" width="960"
  caption="The Safety and Concent primer slide."
 %}


## Get Group Feedback

Okay, so having established your own ethical minimal viable product as a DM, it&#8217;s time to get their input. This can be hard as we don&#8217;t often talk about these topics in casual conversation. Many people find some kind of survey or form useful. So I created a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1XHjWwG3vdyhcX1uyAQT-XqwwhTZBFkW-JD9Ubhn_YUs/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Tabletop RPG Safety & Consent Checklist</a> for use with my group. If you follow that link you can see it too and should be able to make a copy for modification and use in your own game. Drop me a DM on twitter if you have any trouble copying it and I&#8217;ll do what I can to get you what you need.

Note, I did not invent this. The Checklist above is my modified version of the TTRPG Safety Toolkit I mentioned at the top of this post.

Now get out there and run some fun and safe games.

[Captivating Traps]({% link _posts/2021-01-21-create-captivating-traps.md %}) in 5th edition Dungeons & Dragons are more than just damage delivery gimmicks. A great trap communicates something about who created it, the danger you face, and engages the environment in exciting ways. This is an example of trap design that creates an environmental challenge with [Progressive Failures and Rising Tension]({% link _posts/2021-01-03-progressive-failures-and-rising-tension-in-5th-edition.md %}) that engages character skills. I used this trap in my campaign last night to great effect and wanted to share it with the community if it&#8217;s useful for you as well.

## Elevator Boulder Trap

  * **CR:** 4
  * **DC:** 12
  * **Damage:** 4d6 
  * **Secondary Challenge:** 
      * Athletics (Strength) or fall
      * 4d6 fall damage

### Description 

A wooden framed elevator descends one hundred feed down into the caverns below. The elevator itself moves via magical gears that make it climb or descent through use of operating leavers in the elevator at the entries and exits. If the elevator is put in motion without pulling a secondary leaver, the trap is armed. 

When the elevator reaches the half way point of this one-hundred-foot shaft, it trips a lever that drops a boulder from a cabinet in a side wall near the top of the shaft. The boulder plummets down and smashes through the elevator.

### Using this Trap

Players may notice the trap with an Intelligence (Investigate) check at the Trap DC. An Intelligence (Perception) check will allow them to determine the right sequence of levers to disarm the trap. Proficiency and use of Thieves Tools grant advantage on this roll.

If the trap is triggered, describe the sound of something coming lose from the wall above them and the light suddenly being blocked. If a player immediately declares they are moving to the side, give them advantage on the damage roll and subsequent athletics check. Players take 4d6 bludgeoning damage from the boulder crashing into the elevator, or half as much on a successful Dex Save. 

Characters must then make a Strength (Athletics) check against the Trap DC to jump onto the elevator scaffolding. They may make this roll at advantage if they moved quickly to the side during the description. Failing this check means the character falls the rest of the way down the shaft, taking 4d6 bludgeoning damage.

Characters who holding onto the scaffolding may climb down at 15 feet per round without rolling further. They can move up to their full movement speed if they succeed at a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) Check. (Say to reach any unconscious characters below).

## Real World Use

I used this in my heavily modified version of Black Swords from Icewind Dale &#8211; Rime of the Frostmaiden. It worked wonderfully from the DMs point of view; it was a grand challenge. One of the players picked up on the trap being triggered and announced they were moving to the side. Two players ended up hanging onto the scaffolding, two players fell the rest of the way and were brought to zero hit points. The conscious players moved as fast as they could to get the bottom to help the players making Death saves. Overall, it was tense, hit the players hard and shook them up so it achieved the effect that I wanted of bringing the tension up and using some skills in an exciting way. A saving grace of the trap design is not having enemies at the bottom, with the elevator broken the players correctly surmised they could take a short rest and recover.

There&#8217;s been a lot of contentious talk in my feed about building skills challenges in 5th Edition Dungeons and Dragons. Firstly, we need to develop a common understanding of what a skill challenge is in 5e. Secondly, we must get past the issues people have with 4th edition that make them so polarized. Thirdly, we need to focus on how different ways of resolving skills affect pace and tension. Moreover, we need to define some meaningful circumstances that let players drive the use of skills in creative ways. In these ways, we provide creative opportunities to do more than fight, and develop richer games in the process. 

## What is a Skill Challenge? 

A skill challenge is an encounter that allows players to creatively use skills to make progresses and build tension. To be sure, you do not need to require a complex skill challenge in most cases. However, when the scene calls for them, a well crafted skill challenge does for narrative what combat does for action. This means it creates a sense or risk, a way to measure progression, and a clear set of consequences. In other words, skill challenges are every bit as engaging as any other element of the game.

## 4e Skill Challenges, What&#8217;s all This Then?

The main complaint I see about 4th edition skill challenges is that it was a tedious checklist. Rather than a fun game mechanic, it made players feel they had to jump through hoops to complete a task. Indeed, they saw this design more like canned dialog choices in video games than freeform creative problem solving. Undeniably, skill challenges are presented like this in some 4E modules. A point often overlooked is this was not how skill challenges are presented in the 4E PHB and DMG.

I read 4E more kindly, and believe the designers intended these skill challenges to be creative and freeform. However, they also needed to provide DMs with some default structure and progression. Therefore they presented a list of skills to use if some other idea didn&#8217;t occur at the table, counting on the DM to disregard it if needed.

Regardless of what it was, what skill challenges should be fun, or at the very least, fast.

## Proficiency in Skill Tools

{% include imageframe.html

  alt="A group of adventurers leaning over a table, seemingly confused by a map they are looking at"

 %}

Skills suffer from a bit of combat rules evy. In brief, skill use is so contextual and complex it defies the procedural rules used for combat in 5e. In spite of that complexity, skill resolution is relatively light in terms of guidelines when compared to combat. Due to this space inequity, people often assume combat is more important for play in 5e than skill resolution. Although combat is a strong part of most D&D games, the rules emphasis wasn&#8217;t meant to be a statement of priority. 

I&#8217;m going to talk about some of the ways the rules address skill challenges below. Additionally, I&#8217;ll talk about some skill resolution techniques from other games that can be used in 5e. In the end though, all skill checks are basically the same. Which means the DM Sets up the situation and stakes, and the player chooses the action. Then the DM decides what skill resolution method to use and calls for the roll. 

### Rule Zero &#8211; No Risk, No Roll 

The first, and most simple method is to not roll at all. If the player wants to attempt something within their means, there is no risk, and can be tried again until they succeed, do not roll at all. Rolling just to roll is a pointless waste of time. Likewise, rolling for something that can&#8217;t possibly succeed is a frustrating exercise. Therefore, for most simple requests, just decide what is a reasonable outcome and have that happen. 

### Batteries Included

There is more material on resolving skill challenges in 5th edition than people acknowledge. Granted, discussions on skill challenges are a bit more spread out across the core books. In particular, <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/running-the-game#UsingAbilityScores" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chapter 8 of the DMG</a> goes into checks with several variants and specific uses like Social Interactions or Chases. However, it&#8217;s fair to say the DMG is the least read of the core rulebooks and players naturally expect this to be covered in the PHB. Therefore, people miss this frequently and it&#8217;s often a topic of confusion.

The DMG generally presents ways to resolve skill checks that mostly involve a single roll. You&#8217;d have to look to a specific implementation, like the chase rules, for an example of checks over time with progressive success and failure.

#### Types of Checks in the DMG {#h-types-of-checks-in-the-dmg}

  * **Automatic Success** &#8211; Essentially the Rule Zero I listed above.
  * **Straight Roll vs DC** &#8211; The standard check most of us know, using a single roll against a DC. But a binary pass/fail can be inadequate for extended actions or times when drama or tension calls for something more complex.
  * **Success at a Cost** &#8211; A &#8216;fail forward&#8217; mechanic, where failure by a point or two still succeeds but grants some hindrance.
  * **Degrees of Failure** &#8211; A roll that has effects by passing or failing by more than 5 points.
  * **Critical Success or Failure** &#8211; An optional rule that counts a natural 20 as an automatic success, or natural 1 as an automatic failure. (You knew skill checks didn&#8217;t crit right?)

I personally don&#8217;t find a lot of value in degrees of failure or success at a cost. Both rely on a specific value on a single d20 having a particular meaning. Which isn&#8217;t reasonable on a flat probability distribution. I hope the dangers of linking an outcome to the arbitrary &#8220;swinginess&#8221; of a d20 is apparent. However, this is beyond the scope of this post so I&#8217;ll save that discussion for another time. 

### Borrowing From Other Systems {#h-borrowing-from-other-systems}

  * **Pushing a Skill** &#8211; Pulled from <a href="https://www.chaosium.com/content/FreePDFs/CoC/CHA23131%20Call%20of%20Cthulhu%207th%20Edition%20Quick-Start%20Rules.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Cthulhu</a>, it lets you take a single failed skill check and try again at some coast or greater risk. In 5e this could be the danger of catastrophic failure, exhaustion, injury, or some other consequence the DM and Player agree on. When I use these I ask the player to justify by adding something or trying it again in a different way. 
  * **Progression Clock** &#8211; Pulled from <a href="https://bladesinthedark.com/progress-clocks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blades in the Dark</a>, this is close to traditional 4e skill challenges. Where in, you require success in a particular number of skill checks to progress the storyline. The difference here is the assumption this engages the player to suggest creative uses for skills to move things along. Additionally, it assumes the DM is working with the player to provide interesting narrative progression or tension. The progression clock mechanic provides several interesting variations that can provide a lot of tension in 5e. Some of these include danger clocks, racing clocks, tug-of-war clocks, and more. You can use all of these effectively to create exciting skill based encounters in 5e. This method comes as close as anything I&#8217;ve seen to the intention of skill challenges.
  * **Dramatic Tasks** &#8211; Pulled from <a href="https://www.peginc.com/store/savage-worlds-deluxe-pdf-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Savage Worlds</a>, this is party based successes per turn model. This might work with a timed based challenge, but I generally don&#8217;t use this as it is linked to pace and requiring the players to have a particular number of ideas a round.

### The Greatest Skill System of All time 
Okay, maybe not, but I&#8217;m biased. I wrote a post awhile back called [Progressive Failures and Rising Tension]({% link _posts/2021-01-03-progressive-failures-and-rising-tension-in-5th-edition.md %}) that I&#8217;m rather partial to. So, when I need something more than a binary check, I find this method easy to express to the player and not overly complicated. I sometimes combine this method with one of the forms of progression clocks above for a more dynamic experience. In particular, the ability for one player to get another player unstuck or help has been lots of fun when I can get players to use it.

The master stroke is to use the right resolution method at the right time, and get players to work together through it.

## Resolution 

When I create what I call a skill challenge, I typically lay out a scenario, imply some risks and let the player try to figure out creative ways to solve the problem. I don&#8217;t usually tie myself to a specific number of rolls and I try to let things progress naturally. One challenge in skill based encounters is the notion of time. As opposed to combat, which has six second rounds, the time to resolve a skill is less clear. If I have a series of rolls in an encounter I generally try to keep a similar arbitrary time period per check. This way I can usually be consistent about how much to progress the scene per check in a way that keeps it natural. 

In any case, I try to pick a style of resolution appropriate for the scene. I also try to keep pacing in mind, quickly moving through checks that don&#8217;t matter, but creating some space to linger in a dramatic moment. Picking the right method for resolution requires a lot of context and awareness of the game. Although it may seem difficult to know which to choose, it&#8217;s easy to develop a quick instinct for it after trying a few methods out. So I recommend doing just that.

Look over some of these methods and try to use at least one in an intentional way during your next game. It won&#8217;t take long to figure out what methods jive with your style of game and players. Together with a little experimentation and adjustment, you&#8217;ll quickly develop a natural way to select the right method for the right situation.

title: My Current 5e House Rules
author: Scott Turnbull
layout: post
description: A list of house rules I use in my own 5th edition game.
categories:
  - RPG Resources

I get questions frequently about what house rules I&#8217;m using in my own 5th Edition Dungeons & Dragons game so I wanted to post them for everyone. I hope you&#8217;ll find something useful here and tag <a href="https://www.twitter.com/optionalrule" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">me on twitter</a> if you have a question or want to share a rule of your own.  
  
By and large, I stay fairly houserule light. This is because I don&#8217;t think most house rules add anything to a game. More often than not, people are compensating for some cognitive disconnect but it doesn&#8217;t bring much to a group at play. So more or less, I use rules as is with the exception of the one&#8217;s I&#8217;ve listed below.

## House Rules

House rules are additions or modifications to the mechanics of a game. This means they modify or add to a rule in place. 

**Snatch Item:** When trying to use an item in a hostile creatures square, you must succeed at Athletics (Strength) or Acrobatics (Dexterity) roll against the defenders Athletics (Strength) or Acrobatics (Dexterity) to successfully use the item.

**Exhaustion & Death Saves:** The first time a character fails a Death Saving throw after falling to 0hp, they accumulate one level of exhaustion.

**Catch Your Breath:** A character may attempt a DC 15 Athletics (Constitution) check after taking a short rest. They remove one level of exhaustion on a success. They may attempt this once and are able to attempt it again after completing a long rest.

**Friends with Advantage:** Only one player may roll to attempt an outcome for the party like disarming a trap. They may receive &#8220;help&#8221; from another player if that player is proficient in the relevant skill. Both players roll, the highest result is kept.

**Skill Bump:** When attempting a skill roll, a player may be able to make the case that another skill they are proficient in may give them a slight advantage. If the DM approves, give the roll a +1 for that attempt. Another player may try to &#8220;advise&#8221; in the same way to provide the bonus. Any declaration of help must be made before rolling.

**Blocked by Enemies:** You cannot move through an enemy square normally. You may attempt an Dexterity (Acrobatics) check opposed by the enemies Strength or Dexterity check. Success means you are able to move through their square as if it were difficult terrian. 

**Mounted Combat:** Players interested may use the [mounted combat rules]({% link _posts/2021-03-08-mounted-combat-in-5e.md %}) I developed. 

**No Long Rests on the Road** Gaining the benefit of a long rest requires a comfortable place to rest or base camp.  See 
[Perilous Journeys]({% link _posts/2021-07-13-perilous-journeys-in-5e-p1.md %}) for more info.

### **Spells**

  * **Mage Armor** uses the higher of the targets Dex modifier, or casters primary spell ability modifier.

## Table Rules

Table rules are conventions or social norms that use an established rule in a different way. This means it doesn&#8217;t modify or add to an existing rule, but uses that rule in a different way.

  * **2HD at 1st level:** Players start with Max HP plus another HD at 1st level. They do not roll for HPs again until 3rd level.
  * **Private Death Saves:** Death saves should be kept private between the DM and Player. Either PM2DM on the VTT, Discord, or Text as used in the campaign.
  * **Feats Not Used:** The following feats are not used in my game: Telekinetic (Tasha&#8217;s), Observant, Bountiful Luck, & Luck.
  * **Sentinel Feat:** Capped at +1 size for movement change.
  * **Tasha&#8217;s Optional Class Features:** Mostly used from Tasha&#8217;s, check with DM.
  * **Custom Lineages:** Okay by me, let me know if you&#8217;re a variation on a traditional race or what other concept you might have. Variation on traditional races are considered that race for all racial requirements in the system unless otherwise noted.
  * **Xanathar&#8217;s & Tasha&#8217;s Subclasses:** All allowed except for Order of Scribes Wizard, and Twilight Domain Cleric.
  * **Most Recent Class Update Used:** In cases with multiple versions of a class, like Artificer, the most recent version of that class is used.
  * **Intimidating Presence:** May be either CHA or STR based at players description with appropriate description.

## Style & Convention {#h-style-convention}

These are just social contract elements of my sessions I&#8217;d ask you to keep in mind.

  * **Help keep the game moving.** No, non-game related electronic or other stuff.
  * **Honor system.** Act in good faith please.
  * **Be on time and communicate.** If the group sets up a time and place, it&#8217;s respectful of everyone else to be on time and prepared.
  * **Don&#8217;t Roll Unless Asked:** &#8217;nuff said.
  * Lean into some of the ideas I put out there on my blog, bring your own creativity into the game but remember it&#8217;s a shared space.
      * [Thrilling Heroics]({% link _posts/2020-12-22-thrilling-heroics-rules-for-dd-5e.md %}) (especially this one)
      * [Skill Challenges in 5E]({% link _posts/2021-02-09-skill-challenges-in-5e.md %})
      * [Progressive Failures and Rising Tension]({% link _posts/2021-01-03-progressive-failures-and-rising-tension-in-5th-edition.md %})

title: Engaging Players with Magic Item Creation

description: Rules for making magic item component harvesting and magic item creation fun for players in 5th edition games.
categories:
  - RPG Resources

---

Creating your own potions and magic items can be a satisfying element of gameplay in 5th Edition Dungeons & Dragons. General guidelines for crafting different rarity items are provided in the core books, but many gaps exist. Specifically, the details of how to learn to craft items, and how to collect ingredients is left vague. While I don&#8217;t think crafting needs to have a fully gamified system, having some central methodologies can keep things consistent. Notably, a set of rules that create proactive options for players can enhance their engagement with the setting. While, an understandable set of guidelines for item crafting can develop character goals and drive roleplay. Taken together, players who want to craft items can use gathering rules as a fun gameplay hook.

The question is, how to keep this from being a tedious affair?

## Use Existing Guidelines

{% include imageframe.html
  figure_class="float-end ms-4"
  src="/assets/img/steve_stark_480x371.jpeg"
  alt="A woman forging a sword on a firey anvil."
  height="371" width="480"
  caption="Guide for determining difficulty"
 %}

The Dungeon Masters Guide (DMG) and Xanathar&#8217;s Guide to Everything (XGtE) published rules for crafting magic items, including potions. These rules present a time and gold value requirement for crafting an item. However, they can be confusing as the DMG and XGtE give different base values for these activities. Being that XGtE is newer, its values are generally accepted as the new default and I&#8221;ll assume that here too. 

**Item Rarity Time and Value** 


|Rarity|Workweeks*|Create*|Sell|
|--- |:-: |:-: |:-: |
|Common|1|50 gp|100 gp|
|Uncommon|2|200 gp|400 gp|
|Rare|10|2,000 gp|4,000 gp|
|Very rare|25|20,000 gp|40,000 gp|
|Legendary|50|100,000 gp|200,000 gp|
{: .table .table-striped .table-hover}
\* Halved for consumable items like potions

The rules specifies creation cost and time, but not skills or proficiencies in most cases. As a result, it&#8217;s left up to the DM to decide what the actual crafting requirements are. If there isn&#8217;t a benefit to the game from expressly defining this, the DM shouldn&#8217;t bother. However, a more defined system can provide rich character or world building opportunities for groups interested in that kind of play.

In my own games I adjust the level of detail to fit the interest of the player. I list some of those options below.

## Cookbooks and Blueprints

There are no specific guidelines to understand what players know how to create. The easiest solution is to assume that an appropriate proficiency allows someone to craft any item listed in the book. In cases where players are only crafting simple healing potions or scrolls, this is the assumption I use. Alternatively when players want a more rich experience, they seem to enjoy a system that drives them toward research. This means characters have to actively find ways to recover lore, trade recipes, or research in libraries.

To encourage research or recovering lore, characters can craft **_any Common item with appropriate proficiency_**. Additionally, the character selects a number of **_Uncommon items equal to their primary attribute modifier_** they can create. Typically this is intelligence or wisdom, depending on the tradition and craft. Beyond this, **_knowledge to craft additional items needs to be obtain through active play_**. This means characters can find it during quests, learn it from fellow crafters, or uncover it as a part of library research. As a result, it **_creates opportunities during play through character actions or events_**, like any other game element.

The end result is a list of items a character can create on their sheet and a gameplay hook to acquire more. What follows next is, how to create interesting gameplay hooks to gather material and support the creation of items in a fun way.

## Gathering Materials

As presented in the [Summary of 5e Alchemy Rules]({% link _posts/2021-01-24-summary-of-5e-alchemy-rules.md %}), players can** _forage or harvest ingredients for magic item creation_**. These rules are intended to be simple and fast, and leave it to the DM and player to work out description and flavor. In the end, the intention is that the player attempt some action and the DM sets a difficulty and asks for a roll. The **_result is a value of ingredients in gold pieces_** that can be used for the creation of any magic item. Cases where more detail or context is required should be negotiated between players and the DM, but this general guide can serve for most items up through Rare.

Some enchanted flora or minerals may provide ingredients to create magical items. Characters proficient with an appropriate skill or tool kit may attempt a DC 15 check after spending 4 hours gathering. On a success they gather 1d6 GP worth of ingredients. This roll is made with advantage in rich or pristine environments, or disadvantage in sparse or depleted areas.

Also, characters with an appropriate proficiency may attempt to harvest ingredients from some mythic creatures. When appropriate, a player may roll a DC 15 check to harvest 1d10 gp of crafting material per creature CR rating. Alternatively, creatures lower than CR 1 may produce 1 gp of ingredients. These ingredients may be of general use or useful for only specific kinds of effects at the DMs discretion. Notably, these may be items collected from the environment around the creature and not necessarily parts of the creature itself.

### Suggested Skills by Creature Type

These are some suggested skills for harvesting depending on the base creature type involved. This list is a slightly modified version of the one presented in Tasha&#8217;s Caldron of Everything.

|Creature Type|Suggested Skill|
|--- |:-: |
|Aberration|Arcana|
|Beast|Animal Handling, Nature, or Survival|
|Celestial|Arcana or Religion|
|Construct|Arcana|
|Dragon|Arcana, History, or Nature|
|Elemental|Arcana or Nature|

When in doubt of a detail, ask the player to suggest an action. In this way you follow the simple guidelines of 5e where characters describe the action and DMs set the roll.

## Major Ingredients

Sometimes a location or creature is powerful enough to provide the complete materials needed to craft an item. In these cases, the DM should establish potential lore or uses a character may be aware of. An easy rule of thumb is a particular rarity item might be crafted from materials recovered in an encounter or creature of appropriate CR for the item rarity. Additionally, the material should have some related theme to the core ability of the item being created. 

A guide for how to estimate rarity based on CR is provided in Chapter 2 of Xanathar&#8217;s Guide to Everything, under <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/xgte/downtime-revisited#CraftinganItem" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crafting an Item</a>.

These are lose guidelines of course, but more simple than it may initially seem. If an encounter or creature presents some theme, the player asks the DM if it&#8217;s possible to recover something to craft a particular item. Then, the DM decides if that&#8217;s reasonable and compares the CR to the rarity of the targeted item. If the request and CR fits the theme, either let the player recover material or ask them for a DC 15 check to do so. If successful, they have everything they need to craft the item.

Some creatures already provide guidelines for this kind of effect or item creation. For instance, <a href="https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Ice_troll" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ice Trolls</a> list some effects that can be achieved that are thematically tied to the setting and monster abilities. In a similar way, other creatures or locations may provide similar opportunities for item creation. In effect this just expands the treasure system, while engaging the player with active hooks.

## Conclusion

A system of tracking recipes and searching for ingredients can be a great fit for players wanting active hooks to the world. These rules are better suited for collaborative play styles rather than transactional ones. So keep in mind these are rough guidelines to drive expectations and help promote negotiations and active participation. As with everything, the goal is to have fun. If you find these fun, drop me a note on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/optionalrule). I would love to hear your thoughts.

title: The Zen of Awarding Experience for Roleplaying
author: Scott Turnbull
layout: post
description: Guidelines for how to award experience points for roleplaying encounters in your 5th edition game.
categories:
  - RPG Resources

---
It&#8217;s a weakness of experience based advancement in 5e D&D that it directly addresses only one of the three pillars of play, combat. This forces DMs to either ignore advancement through social interaction and exploration, or create some way to include it. Ignoring it seems a bad option for a &#8216;pillar&#8217; of play and creates a sense of wasted time. Likewise, a poorly crafted experience system for these pillars messes with pacing and play balance. Therefore, **_a simple, clear, and consistent method for including all pillars helps diversify play_** without sacrificing progress. In this post, I&#8217;m going to talk about how I do that with the social interaction pillar. So this is how I award experience for roleplaying in my campaigns.

## Encountering Difficulties

For the purposes of assigning a difficulty to roleplaying encounters, the <a href="http://dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/building-combat-encounters#EvaluatingEncounterDifficulty" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Encounter Difficulty</a> system works well enough. Of course for these encounters, we don&#8217;t have to worry about number of foes or individual party thresholds. So we just need a method to assess the significance of a roleplaying event, the social equivalent of difficulty. To do that we need a simple statement about assessing difficulty. In terms of roleplaying, that statement is **_&#8220;what is at stake, and how much am I changing the world?&#8221;_**

## Difficulties of Stakes & Change 

For roleplaying to be a learning experience, it has to produce some **_gail or loss (stakes) and change the situation_** in some meaningful way. Additionally, just as combat is a series of rolls, maneuvers, and choices, so is a roleplaying encounter. Therefore it requires a complex series of interactions that result in a gain or loss that changes the world. With this as a basis, we can begin to classify the roleplaying encounter in terms of Encounter Difficulty. Those difficulties for roleplaying encounters being **_Easy, Medium, Hard, and Profound (i.e. Deadly)_**.

Rating the difficulty of a roleplaying encounter usually comes afterwards, once everyone has set the stakes and sees the result of the change. Both stakes and change can be quickly rated as minor or major. A minor stake or change is an incremental shift in a relationship, access, or safety. A major stake or change puts something valuable to the players in significant danger, and causes some big shift in the way the world works. Of course it should be noted, that **_what is considered major or minor shift as the players increase in power_**. Therefore what is a major world change at 3rd level, might be insignificant to a 16th level group. It&#8217;s all relative to the expected influence the party has on the world.

### Assigning Experience Point Values

{% include imageframe.html
  figure_class="float-end ms-4"
  src="/assets/img/RPDifficulties-480x319.jpg"
  alt="Comparative chart showing relationship betwen change and stakes."
  height="330" width="480"
  caption="Guide for determining difficulty"
 %}

What we want out of all of this is to assign an experience point value for a set of roleplaying encounters. So taking the method above we determine if the difficulty of the roleplaying challenge as Easy, Medium, Hard, or Profound (i.e. Deadly). 

  * **Easy:** A minor challenge in one area of stake or change and no challenge in the other.
  * **Medium:** A minor challenge in both stake and change, or a major challenge in one of those with no challenge in the other.
  * **Hard:** A major challenge in one area of stake or change, and a minor challenge in the other.
  * **Profound:** Both a major stake and a major change.

**_This doesn&#8217;t have to be more complex than it needs to be. Just look at what was done, what was at risk, and what changed and make your best assessment._**

Once you have a Difficulty, just Assign an experience value to it based on the equivalent CR to the average party level. Then grant this amount for each member in the party, and that is your roleplaying experience for the session. You can find these values in <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/monsters#Challenge" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chapter 12 of the Basic Rules</a> under Experience Points by Challenge Rating as well as in the DMG. The difficulties correspond to CR like so:

  * **Easy:** Average Party level &#8211; 2.
  * **Medium:** Average Party Level -1.
  * **Hard:** Average Party Level.
  * **Profound:** Average Party Level +1.

Therefore, a Hard roleplaying encounter for a party of 4 level 2 characters would be worth (450xp * 4 characters) 1800 xp. Some DMs are tempted to award roleplaying experience to individual characters and my advice is not to. The adventuring group in an RPG is connected to one another for good or bad. This means individual experience awards creates a scenario where the character talking gets all the reward, but the whole party deals with the fallout. So be sure to **avoid situations of individual reward and shared risks**. Additionally, individual rewards needlessly penalize players with a more quiet or passive playstyle.

## Conclusion

Overall, this method is more simple than it might sound from reading this article. Just quickly determine the overall value of what was at stake and how much the world changed. Then give that an equivalent CR value, multiply it by the number of players in the party and award the experience. This can be useful in rewarding proactive play and ideas that don&#8217;t involve combat, while still focusing the party on moving forward. Additionally, systematically thinking in this way may help DMs develop roleplaying encounters with stakes and change in mind. Thus enhancing their overall game.

One last note, this system is intended for roleplaying encounters that don&#8217;t have an apparent experience value to assign. In cases where players have a combat encounter they can resolve through roleplaying, just give the party the experience value of that combat encounter. Doing this retains the value of the encounter, regardless of how it was resolved. 

Now get out there and run some great games.

description: An analysis of the varying difficulty and pace of character leveling at different points in 5th edition.
categories:
  - Analysis

---


Planning for how quickly players gain levels in 5e Dungeons and Dragons is a key element of campaign preparation. Using milestone advancement, the DM can select when and how a party levels up. However, in experience based systems this is generally a matter of the number and difficulties of encounters. Therefore, knowing how quickly players gain levels at different points in the game lets the DM plan better in advance. This means DMs using experience based leveling can anticipate how encounters drive the pace of their campaign.

This started when I asked myself, how many equivalent CR creatures would a player have to face before leveling. Which seems like a straightforward question but becomes complicated when you start to consider party size, CR shifts, or multiple opponents. Some of the charts resulting from those queries are included below, but the takeaway wasn&#8217;t terribly helpful. To be sure, how many foes players can expect to face is important for things like treasure or [Engaging Players with Magic Item Creation]({% link _posts/2021-02-17-engaging-players-with-magic-item-creation.md %}). But the number or even CR of foes isn&#8217;t as important as the relative pace of advancing. In other words, **_how fast to characters level at different points in their lifetime and how does this effect the game?_**

## The Pace of Advancement
{% include imageframe.html
  figure_class="float-end ms-4"
  src="/assets/img/relativedifficultyleveling-480x330.jpg"
  alt="A bar chart showing the data of relative difficulty by level group."
  height="330" width="480"
 %}

Compiling the raw data, it became clear that different groups of levels followed different behavior patterns. The individual groups aren&#8217;t as important as what it tells the DM they should be preparing for. That is that, up through 10th level, the pace of leveling either gets more difficult or levels off. This allows players and DMs to adjust to new powers and abilities at a reasonable place. The biggest change comes post 10th level, where difficulty drops to only about 1.6 times that of 1st and 2nd levels. 

This means that DMs and players are dealing with new and powerful abilities at a consistently faster rate than any other point in the game. Additionally, at later levels it is very common for parties to face CR encounters much higher than their average level, increasing the pace even more. 

## Impacts & Considerations

There are few impacts to consider given this realization.

  * Campaigns use tier 3 and 4 play the least, so a sudden rise (doubling) in the pace of leveling is likely to catch some DMs off guard.
  * You might have misaligned expectations if players used to higher tier play expect milestone to follow a similar pace to experience. This could be as simple a fix as talking about these expectations. But I&#8217;ve run so few higher level games, I wouldn&#8217;t have known had I not compiled this data.
  * When planning for tier 3 and 4 play, get to know those abilities well ahead of time since they&#8217;ll come at you fast.
  * Include this in considering how the pacing of your game is going to be perceived. Hitting level 3 of a 6 level campaign isn&#8217;t half way there, it&#8217;s more likely 1/3rd of the way there. Likewise, hitting 10th level of a 20th level campaign is probably closer to 2/3rds of the way there instead of half. 

In any case this isn&#8217;t earth shattering, it&#8217;s just a matter of setting the right expectations. Also, it effects how soon you can expect to bring in elements of different tiers of play into your campaign. 

I thought this was worth nothing because I found myself surprised by the relative drop in difficulty at higher tiers of play. I thought it was worth sharing with you as well. Now get out there and run some great games.

Few things are more iconic than the image of someone charging into battle on horseback. Yet, 5e doesn&#8217;t have satisfying rules to make mounted combat a fun part of play. So I created these rules to provide [thrilling options]({% link _posts/2020-12-22-thrilling-heroics-rules-for-dd-5e.md %}) for mounted combat by players, while maintaining balance with existing rules and abilities. As with all rules, these are guidelines and the DM should do what is fun and fast, using what adds to the game, and ignore the rest.

  alt="A knight with sword drawn riding on a horse."
  height="600" width="480"
  caption="Photo by Kayla Koss from Unsplash"
 %}


## Fit with Existing Rules

These rules work well with the existing <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/combat#MountedCombat" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mounted Combat</a> and other rules in the core books, and expand on them in a few key ways. First, it differentiates between rider training and different types of trained mounts. Second, it blends better with martial character options like <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/classes#ExtraAttack" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Extra Attack</a>, and adds additional options for bonding with a mount. Third, it provides a dynamic experience when working with and controlling mounts in combat. Together, these options can be used by any class to make mounts effective in the right circumstances.

[Arcadia issue #1]({% link _posts/2021-01-17-thoughts-on-the-first-issue-of-arcadia.md %}) released an excellent set of Mounted Combat rules also. Those rules are aimed toward monsters and action oriented combat, and are an excellent addition to any game. You&#8217;ll find some excellent options for mounted opponents and I recommend you check those out.

These rules focus on the players experience while mounted, to give a greater depth of options and more fun.

## Rules in a Nutshell

  1. Anyone can get from place to place on a gentle trained mount.
  2. Untrained riders have disadvantage on most rolls while mounted.
  3. Trained riders can control mount movement with an object interaction and have them take a dash, disengage, or dodge action.
  4. Riding mounts are fast and light but may panic in combat, war mounts are hearty and aggressive.
  5. Trained riders may be able to bond with mounts to do things like swap rolls or use a bonus action to allow the mount to attack.

## Rider Training

Anyone can get from place to place on a trained mount in good conditions, but a trained rider is capable of some amazing exploits. Any character proficient in Animal Handling, land vehicles, or with any ability that works with being mounted is a trained rider. 

Riders one size smaller than a mount have their melee reach measured from the edge of the mount. However, riders more than two categories smaller would need a special circumstance such as adequate reach to perform a melee attack. 

**_Untrained riders_** suffer disadvantage on any attack roll and ability check when on a trained mounted. Additionally, they must use **_an action_** to control a trained mount to take the Dash, Disengage, or Dodge action. Otherwise, the mount acts independently as makes sense for its type.

**_Trained riders_** make ability checks and attacks normally when controlling a trained mounted. Also, in combat, the mount and rider share the same initiative count allowing the rider to act as a unit. Further, a trained rider who shows great care and spends adequate time may become bonded with a mount. This allows the bounded mount to use the riders ability modifier, saving throw bonus, or AC in place of their own or vice versa. 

Riders must spend half their movement to mount a willing creature within 5 feet or to dismount. The movement cost to mount or dismount may be reduced to 5 feet with a successful DC 15 Dexterity (acrobatics) or Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. A failure means you either fail to mount and stop moving, or fall prone if dismounting.

## Trained Mounts

A creature requires considerable training to serve as an effective mount. This training familiarizes them enough to follow common commands and directions. While more advanced training may produce mounts with great skill to work with riders in battle. Note the type of training in the creatures stat block. 

**Riding mounts** are trained to skillfully move and maneuver under the command of a trained rider. They will not willingly move toward danger and require a DC 12 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check by a rider to force them to do so. A sudden surprise, nearby combat, or attack may cause a riding mount to panic. If the mount panics, the rider must make a DC 12 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check or the animal will **bolt**. Intelligent mounts are not subject to panic and behave normally as a creature of its type and personality.

**War mounts** are specially selected and trained to be hearty and aggressive in combat. They begin with a hostile attitude toward most creatures, including a new rider. In fact, they will attempt to **_buck any rider_** they are not at least indifferent toward. However, their nature makes them well suited for fighting and they are **_not panicked by attacks, combat, or w_hen surprised**. Additionally, they will freely move toward danger under control of rider. 

### Controlling a Mount

Mounts may either act on their own, or a trained rider may use their object interaction ability to control them. The initiative of a controlled mount changes to match the rider. Once controlled, the rider and mount work as a unit. This means the** _rider uses the mounts movement in place of their own_**. Additionally, the rider in control may direct the mount to take a dash, dodge, or disengage action. Bonding with a mount offers riders in control additional abilities as listed below.

A character may draw or sheath a weapon as a free action as part of the object interaction required to control a mount.

### Summoned & Companion Mounts

Consider any mount summoned with **_Find Steed_** or **_Find Greater Steed_** a war mount bounded to the character that summoned it. Mounts created with **_Phantom Steed_** follow the rules of a bounded riding mount but are not subject to panic. 

Animal companions used as mounts follow their normal rules where appropriate, are considered bonded war mounts for purposes control and abilities while mounted. 

### Bonded Mounts

Forming a bond with a mount requires effort to establish and maintain on the part of the rider. Following a process similar to <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/adventuring#SocialInteraction" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">social interactions</a> in Chapter 8 of the DMG, a mount has a particular attitude toward the rider based on how it&#8217;s been treated. **_Untrained mounts_** and **_War Mounts_** usually start with **_hostile attitudes_**, **_riding mounts_** start as **_indifferent_**. Typically, after each full day of riding or training with a mount, the rider may make a DC 10 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. This roll is made with disadvantage if stressed or in combat combat during that period. A success means the mounts attitude improves by one category.

Once a mount is friendly, the rider may designate the mount as bonded. A rider and mount may only have one bond at a time. The DM may call for the bond to end after extended separations, or other circumstances like hard treatment or conditions.

Bounded mounts that are integrated strongly into play may use the **_sidekick rules from Taha&#8217;s Caldron of Everything_** if approved by the DM. Doing so uses the sidekick Warrior rules in most cases.

A trained rider controlling a **_bonded war or riding mount_** may use their reaction to **_swap an ability check, saving throw, or AC_**. Meaning the mount or the rider may use the ability check, saving throw, or AC of the other. This effect lasts until the beginning of the riders next turn, or until the rider dismounts or is unseated.

A trained rider controlling a **_bonded war mount_** may use their **_bonus action_** to allow the mount to use **_any action in their stat block_**, including an attack.

### Bolting & Bucking

In some circumstances, a mount may have cause to flee a situation and bolt. This means the mount is **_uncontrolled and uses its action to move away_** from the source of its fear. Normally, a mount will use the dash action but may opt for dodge or disengage as is appropriate for the creatures intelligence and situation. During this, a rider may attempt a DC 15 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check as an action, to regain control of the mount. While running, or after a rider fails to regain control, a mount may also attempt to **_buck the rider_** as an action.

A mount that tries to buck its rider makes a strength check, opposed by the riders Strength or Dexterity (Animal Handling) check. If the rider fails the check, they are unseated. 

## Unseating a Rider

Riders are knocked off a mount if some effect separates them, such as a successful shove. Additionally a rider that is knocked prone is also knocked off their mount. If an effect moves a mount against its will, any rider must make a Dexterity (Animal Handling) check either at the DC for the effect that moved the mount or 10, whichever is higher.

A rider knocked off a mount takes falls prone in a logical spot next to the mount. Additionally they may suffer other appropriate effects depending on the circumstance, such as falling off a tall or flying mount. In addition to any other effects, a rider knocked off a moving mount makes a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save they take 1d6 damage, or 2d6 if the mount was dashing, or half as much on a successful save. 

## Equipment

Most mounts require some sort of bridle and saddle to control properly. In most cases, any rolls to control a mount or avoid being unseated are made with** _disadvantage without the proper equipment_**. The core books list a number of options for saddles, all of which work well with these rules.

title: 'Imagery & Art Resources for RPG Creators'
author: Scott Turnbull
layout: post
description: A list of different art and image resources you can use when creating your TTRPG content.
categories:
  - Misc

---
Evocative artwork and imagery is a great add to any 5e fan resource, but finding usable images can be a challenge. I aggregated this list of resources for myself to help navigate the the different resources for potentially usable artwork in RPGs. I also asked some followers on twitter for their recommendations and aggregate all of those together here. I hope you&#8217;ll find something useful to help you create more works and **_honor the artists who put so much work into their own creations_**.

As with any guide to using images, I need to remind everyone this is **_not a legal guide to IP_**. When using anything, keep the published policies in mind and always follow the artists guidance on terms of use, typically supplied at the resource. Also, remember to credit and link the artist if you can.

A few of these policies or resources or 5e specific because that is the most common system by far. Also, it should be noted, WotC has done a lot of work to make material available for fans, particularly for free fan material.

## Understanding Use

These are just a few links that can help you understand a few important context to using images related to RPGs. It is NOT legal advice and always check the original artists copyright statement for acceptable use.

  * <a href="https://company.wizards.com/en/legal/fancontentpolicy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wizards of the Coast Fan Content Policy</a> &#8211; WotC is **_incredibly generous with fan_**s who want to use their IP to create free material. Check out their policy but basically, you&#8217;re free to use most of their art for free products, and you can use a lot of it for paid products you sell off the DMs Guild.
      * <a href="https://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/fan-site-kit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WotC Fan Site Kit</a> &#8211; Lots of resources and more use terms to be aware of.
  * <a href="https://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems-reference-document-srd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Open Gaming License</a> &#8211; There has been a lot of drift over time with this. The original OGL was published as part of 3rd Edition but has undergone some revisions since. In 5e terms this details what you can use for your own published works, otherwise you&#8217;ll have to publish under a resource like DMs Guild.
  * <a href="https://creativecommons.org/use-remix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Creative Commons</a> &#8211; This is by far the most common license granted by artists for use. There are some variations that determine how to properly use it and it&#8217;s worth knowing CC terms.

## Guides

There are a few guides on how to use art and imagery I found particularly useful and I wanted to link those as well. Again, these are not legal advice.

  * <a href="https://worldbuilderblog.me/2017/09/28/art-resources-for-rpg-publishers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Art Resources for RPG Publishers</a> by James Intercoso.
  * <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/8p0vnl/cite_the_art_you_use_the_why_and_how_highly/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reddit Guide on Using and Citing Art</a>

## Resources

What follows here are libraries, repositories, and other services I usually look across for usable art when putting together content. If you have any suggestions for good art resources with allowable use policies, drop me a DM on <a href="https://www.twitter.com/optionalrule" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">twitte</a>r and I&#8217;ll try to add it. 

### Official 5e Sources

These are a few official sources of art and media from Wizards of the Coast.

### Stock Art & Imagery Services

Various stock art option exists and are commonly used by a lot of fan creators, so you&#8217;ll likely see some familiar images. Be sure to check out the terms of use for the artwork. Some allow only some types of publications, some have different prices for online media versus print quality images, etc.

  * <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/search/fantasy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shutterstock Fantasy Images</a> &#8211; Subscription or per item based. They have a surprisingly large amount of fantasy art. Use other search terms. You&#8217;ll notice a LOT of art you&#8217;ve probably seen in DMSGuild and OGL publications here.

### Artist Portfolio Portals

A few online services offer artists a place to feature their work and share their portfolio. This is a great source of inspiration but it&#8217;s important to understand this is not there for us to use any way we want. Much of the art is under artist copyright, some is there under CC terms but you&#8217;ll have to check the source. My tip here is to look for something using &#8220;creative commons&#8221; as a search term.

  * <a href="https://www.artstation.com/search?q=Creative%20Commons&sort_by=relevance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Artstation</a> &#8211; Lots of professional artists, not all is usable but you can find a lot of Magic the Gathering art here usable under the WotC policy above. You can also look for &#8216;Creative Commons&#8217; in the search box and get back a lot of neat art.
  * <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DeviantArt</a> &#8211; Probably the most well known archive for aspiring artists. Again you&#8217;ll need to watch out for the use policy but many artists are fine with credit.

### Free Art and Imagery Repositories {#h-free-art-and-imagery-repositories}

description: How to better understand Surprise in 5th Edition and user it more dynamically in your game.
---
Surprise is one of the most consistently asked about elements of 5e Dungeons & Dragons, and a source of constant confusion. This is partially because surprise ran differently in previous editions of the game. But also, the narrow examples and explanation make it unclear when surprised would be a factor. Lastly, the way surprise works with the imitative system can seem odd and counter-intuitive to many players. The solution is to break down surprise for what it is, and step away from the individual rolls to understand encounters holistically instead of procedurally.

## There Is No Surprise Round {#h-there-is-no-surprise-round}

For those of you who don&#8217;t understand this reference, there was a concept in previous editions of D&D called a surprise round. The details aren&#8217;t important because it doesn&#8217;t exist in 5e. **_There is no surprise round in 5e D&D_** and we need to stop using that term as it&#8217;s confusing people. Indeed, players who only know 5e use this term because hold overs from previous editions keep using it. Additionally, the 5e rules references _&#8216;sides&#8217;_ in the surprised description, mistakenly causing more confusion for readers. So, we need to stop saying it and explaining it. **_It&#8217;s time for the surprise round to die._**

## What Is Surprise Then? {#h-what-is-surprise-then}

**_Surprise may happen when someone is unaware or unready for combat._** If surprised, they **_cannot move_, _take an action,_ bonus action, _or reaction on their first turn_**. Determine this on an individual basis at the very start of combat, then determine positions, and roll initiative. Most importantly, don&#8217;t overthink it and don&#8217;t get lost in bad examples. All it means is that, for whatever reason, some or all of the people can&#8217;t act or move immediately.

### Determining Surprise {#h-determining-surprise}

According to the rules, surprise is only a factor if at least one side is trying to be stealthy, but this is a **_bad example_**. In truth, there are many reasons surprise may be a factor in combat. For instance, players may be in a merchant disguises to deceive an enemy before an ambush. Alternatively, a distraction may misdirect guards otherwise ready for combat, leading to surprise. So framing surprise as a simple matter of who can see who creates a lot of the initial confusion. The easiest solution to this is to understand the difference between unaware of danger, and unready for combat.

Someone who doesn&#8217;t know danger is present is **_unaware_**, while **_unready_** means you&#8217;re not prepared for combat. Each affects surprise slightly differently, but conflating these two is a big source of confusion. Understanding the differences between these two states can lead to a lot of rich tactics and roleplay during games. Instead of a simple matter of line of sight, players using disguise, deceits, diplomacy, distractions and more, are a viable action to gain the upper hand. Therefore, understanding the context of surprise encourages richer play and more dynamic combats.

#### Have Your Cake and Murder it too {#h-have-your-cake-and-murder-it-too}

The most direct case for surprised is when someone is both **_unaware and unready_** for combat. This might mean targets sleeping, or lounging around and distracted without knowing danger is there. They are easy to catch off guard, and in these cases, I make **_no extra roll and surprise is automatic_**. Whatever happened to allow the danger to get close enough without being detected is enough to cause surprise. In essence, the target has already failed their surprise roll at the start of combat by being so unprepared.

#### Treachery for Fun and Profit {#h-treachery-for-fun-and-profit}

Cases of someone being **_aware but unready_** mean they know the potential source of danger is there, but for some reason assume combat wouldn&#8217;t happen. For example, targets talking to a group disguised as harmless merchants. Alternatively, the target may be aware someone is there in a crowd with no indication a fight is about to happen. In these cases, a check is called for to determine surprise based on the setup. This might be a deception check versus the target&#8217;s insight, or perhaps a disguise versus their investigate. In these cases, stealth isn&#8217;t at play, the target is aware of what is around them but don&#8217;t perceive it as a danger. 

#### I Told You So, and Other Last Words {#h-i-told-you-so-and-other-last-words}

Someone who is **_unaware but ready_** for danger is vigilant for trouble but doesn&#8217;t know about a specific or imminent threat. This might include an alert guard on patrol encountering a hidden ambush. These cases can be tricky, and largely depends on how imminent the target knows danger is. In most common situations, I recommend using a standard perception check versus stealth to determine surprise. If the target is on **_high alert_** due to some notification simply roll initiative as normal, assume no surprise, and remember the rules on advantage and unseen attackers. However, an effective distraction may even surprise someone on high alert. So, DMs should use common sense and good rulings to reward effective tactics.

## Surprised and Initiative {#h-surprised-and-initiative}

Surprise does not affect initiative in any way for either side in the combat. This can lead to a few awkward situations where the character initiating the combat goes later in the initiative than their allies. Additionally, the rules as written imply unsurprised enemies might go before the action that initiated combat, leading to even more confusion. This just causes a bit of cognitive dissonance for many players and DMs. However, examining the situation and using an appropriate option can eliminate that quickly. So let&#8217;s consider a few options.

### The Quick and the Dead {#h-the-quick-and-the-dead}

After rolling initiative, it&#8217;s entirely possible some combatants go before the character starting the combat. For example, an ambush may begin with an archer firing an arrow, however several of their allies may score higher in initiative. In this case, the rules have them ready an action to go immediately after the archer fires, resolving them in original initiative order. This is straight forward and uses the rules as written but does put the faster characters at a disadvantage, particularly if they have Extra Attack. An easy house rule solution might be to just put the archer at the top of the initiative, or allow the allies full actions. My personal recommendation is to step away from the specifics and just let the combat flow naturally. There&#8217;s little utility in getting into specifics of readied actions and putting some characters at disadvantage. 

### The Quick and the Sad {#h-the-quick-and-the-sad}

Things are even more confusing when targets of an ambush are unsurprised and go higher in the initiative than the character starting combat. This is perhaps the most confusing case for many players and there are a few ways to handle this. You could simply say that without something to act against, any ambushed target higher in the initiative simply takes no action. In effect, this is the same as saying ambushed characters with a high initiative rolls for surprised at disadvantage. This is because they can lose their action as a result of the surprise check or initiative. Alternatively, and I think more logically, just have the faster enemy go as normal and chalk it up to the action happening all at once. I recommend this as it slows things down less and most can accept that logic.

The key is to remember that this can worth either or both ways. It&#8217;s possible all sides in an encounter may have some participants who are surprised. These situations can work for the player or against them so consistency and clarity is important to keep players engaged in the action.

## Conclusion {#h-conclusion}

Surprise doesn&#8217;t have to be as confusing as most people seem to think it is. If the targets are completely unaware and unready for danger just say they&#8217;re surprised. Alternatively use an appropriate opposed skill check depending on the situation, and keep in mind passive skills if it speeds things along. Then just roll initiative normally and try to take the most simple and direct means to get everyone on the board and acting, without unnecessarily putting someone at a disadvantage. They key is to keep things fast and furious and not get too hung up on procedure.

Now get out there and run some great games.

I greatly enjoyed my recent interview on the podcast, <a href="https://www.thinkingcritically.co.uk/agency/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Thinking Critically: A D&D Discussion</a>. We talk about agency in games in all it&#8217;s many forms, what agency is and isn&#8217;t, where it ends, how it&#8217;s traded, and how it interacts with game mechanics. I highly recommend the podcast for anyone running tabletop RPGs of any kind.

For this insightful episode I am joined by Scott, a.k.a <a href="https://optionalrule.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@optionalrule</a>, and we talk about the incredibly important topic of agency. It&#8217;s a term that gets bandied around a lot, carrying with it an awful lot of weight. In this hour, Scott and I begin to unpack some of that weight and how it can drastically and dramatically impact the gameplay experience. Starting by clarifying some common misconceptions and misinterpretations, we define what &#8220;agency&#8221; _really_ is within the TTRPG experience. When you have so many options on the table, where do you draw the line? Indeed, the GM is player too with their own pool of agency, and it&#8217;s that trading of agency which leads to interesting and dynamic games. We finish on the importance of trust, something not always directly associated with agency, but the two are often intrinsically linked. The more you trust each other, the more you&#8217;re willing to part with to increase the enjoyment of everyone at the table, and I can&#8217;t think of a more poetic explanation than that!</blockquote>

title: The Language of Monsters in 5e
author: Scott Turnbull

description: A count and analysis of languages listed for monsters in 5th edition statblocks.
categories:

---
Many monsters in 5th Edition Dungeons & Dragons list a language in their stat block. Aside from its ability to hurl insults in combat, sharing a language can open options for lore or negtiation during play. But which languages to most monsters speak and understand? This isn&#8217;t an easy question to answer because DnD does not provide their monster stat blocks in an easily parsable format. So I found <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/8zvr6s/the_great_dd5e_monster_spreadsheet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Great DnD 5e Monster Spreadsheet</a> online, cleaned up the data and began to parse out some of the the answers.

_As an aside, it&#8217;s the digital age, can we put up some resources that are parsable to cut down on the hand editing._

What follows is a table with the resulting number of stat blocks where the listed language appears. I have excluded listing for any language, or all languages as that is beside the point. Perhaps not relevant, but I found it interesting that a number of creature stat blocks listed Telepathy as a language, so I left that in. Also, there are a number of languages I didn&#8217;t know existed at all such as Ice Toad. This includes 799 stat blocks from all the official books released so far. These were hand entered so there are some errors but I have tried to clean those up as best I can.

title: Monster Resistance Totals in 5e
author: Scott Turnbull
layout: post
description: A breakdown and analysis of monster resistances across all the 5th edition monster statblocks.
categories:
  - Analysis
  - Monsters

---
Taking down monsters in 5th Edition Dungeons & Dragons is arguably what you will spend the most time doing in game. Defeating a creature isn&#8217;t just a matter of damage, as many monsters will also have Weaknesses (**W**), Resistances (**R**), or Immunities (**I**). Monster with a particular weakness takes double the amount of damage from that type of attack. Likewise, a foe with resistance will only take half the amount of damage from that particular damage type. And in some cases, an enemy that is immune to a particular effect will take no damage at all from it. Therefore, understanding resistances can be a critical element to surviving as an adventurer or planning as a DM. 

## The Reoccuring Context 

Two topics that come up often online are:

  * Do resistances matter and how much? 
  * Does it matter if a DM lets players reskin spells to any damage or save type?

My instinctive answer to these questions has always been &#8216;absolutely&#8217;, but getting numbers is the only real way to answer. So I set about doing just that.

## Getting Data to Parse

Reliable structured data is difficult to get for many things in 5e. This is something that I urge WotC to do something about, but that&#8217;s a discussion for another day.

I ran across <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/8zvr6s/the_great_dd5e_monster_spreadsheet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Great D&D5e Monster Spreadsheet</a> thread on reddit. This is a great fan effort of manually entered data for 799 monsters from various core books, as well as many Homebrew monster. I choose to focus only on monster stat blocks from official sources and <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sx7Cc94yHu3UPjHf0uv1mHA8IoVyTxB4UWqGyLmUm6g/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">copied my own version of the spreadsheet</a> to clean up a bit. The numbers and analytics you see here are from that data. If you run across an error or have a comment about it, just drop me a <a href="https://www.twitter.com/optionalrule" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">line on twitter</a>.

I make some light observations about the data but there are other creators more adept than I about obptimization. My goal here is to get the numbers.

## Monster Stat Block Totals Grouped by CR

I&#8217;ve shared a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O2dyuRcBcMojO7cCwT5kHKRAK0AMenAQpCmazgCEn38/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spreadsheet of this chart</a> for anyone to view, but had to use the image below because my poor website didn&#8217;t handle the table very well. This includes both damage types and conditions and some numbers appear large because of multiple versions of a similar monster. Still, some of the results surprised me. In no particular order:

  * The number of resistances sub CR 5 surprised me. PCs generally don&#8217;t have access to magic weapons in that range so this makes combat harder and more varied. I have to wonder if this is a factor in why the game seems to work so much better in tier 1 and 2.
  * Cold resistance was higher than I expected, which is odd given how few cold damage spells there are. For reference there are only 5 spells that do cold damage in the PHB.
  * Poison and Poisoned resistance was very high. Again, the number of spells and abilities that do poison damage are very few. Only 3 spells in the PHB do poison damage.
  * Many people on twitter commented on the relatively few weaknesses. I like this however as monsters are difficult to keep around for more than a few rounds already. If weakness was common, too many Boss fights would be one round combats.

## Monster Saves

| Save Prof | Total | Percent |
| --------- | :---: | :-----: |
| CHA       | 139   | 17.40%  |
| CON       | 151   | 18.90%  |
| DEX       | 127   | 15.89%  |
| INT       | 74    | 9.26%   |
| STR       | 38    | 4.76%   |
| WIS       | 225   | 28.16%  |
{: .table .table-striped .table-hover}

Monster saves are also a big influence on how likely they are to be affected by an ability or spell. So I totaled how frequently stat blocks listed a particular save proficiency. My take away here is that a good bit of metagame design went into these choices, but I don&#8217;t know that for sure. Obviously the actual attribute modifier has a big influence on a save but it&#8217;s hard to ignore the choices. Wisdom as the most frequent save proficiency says to me the designers were trying to make sure monsters aren&#8217;t locked up too often by conditions. Additionally, the fact that Dex save proficiency wasn&#8217;t near the top says to me they didn&#8217;t want monsters to avoid damage. 

The most surprising result was the relative lack of Strength save proficiencies. Again, I see the metagame at work here. So few spells require a Strength save that it seems rather pointless. Additionally, monsters often have a high strength value already so proficiency is just overkill.

## Conclusion

So that&#8217;s it. In my own context this will help me with balance for player designed spells and assessing third party or official supplements. I hope you&#8217;re able to derive something useful for planning your games out of this. If you have an observation about it, tag me on twitter or drop me a DM. This is a starting place and rough guide though, and the devil will always be in the details. It is good though to comment based on numbers instead of strawman examples and intuition.

Now get out there and run some great games.

description: A breakdown and analysis of spell save distribution among 5th edition spellcasters.

I recently started aggregating some data I&#8217;ve gathered about spells from 5e Dungeons & Dragons. Primarily, this has been for fun and to see if I&#8217;d find anything surprising or interesting. Additionally, I wanted to get some numbers to help me assess additional spells or subclasses for my home game. So I hope you&#8217;ll find this fun and interesting yourself and I would love to hear any observations you have.

These are the result of analyzing 477 spells across the Players Handbook, Xanathar&#8217;s Guide to Everything, and Tasha&#8217;s Caldron of Everything. 

## 5e Spell Saves by Class

|Save Type|Artificer|Bard|Cleric|Druid|Paladin|Ranger|Sorcerer|Warlock|Wizard|Total|
|--- |:-: |:-: |:-: |:-: |:-: |:-: |:-: |:-: |:-: |:-: |
|Dexterity|16|4|8|25||8|36|7|43|64|
|Wisdom|2|30|9|10|5|1|21|21|38|50|
|Strength|2||1|14|1|3|10|3|12|20|
|Charisma||7|12|2|4||3|5|9|16|
|Constitution|9|10|10|19|4|1|32|20|40|54|
|Intelligence||6|1|1|||5|6|9|11|
{: .table .table-striped .table-hover}

I found a few of these results surprising and overall the implied intention behind the design of spells saves by class can help with subclass design. For instance, the Bard being so heavily invested in Wisdom saves emphasises their focus on enchantment and the mind. Likewise, the Druid&#8217;s Strength save focus is a defacto statement of their magic interacting with the physical world. Additionally, the relative even distribution of Wizards saves speaks to their flexibility. Lastly, drives home the point of common observations like the over loading of Dexterity. 

Overall my read here is that the type of saves given to a spell is intentionally significant. So, when vetting a new spell from a supplement, UA, or created by a player, this seems important to keep in mind.

## 5e Spell Conditions & Damage 

Again a bit of a data dump here, but this is a tally of the number of spells that inflict a condition or particular damage type by class. As with saves above, I think it&#8217;s fair to say there is an implied intentional design here. For instance, the lack of condition inflicting spells for Artificers and Paladin&#8217;s clearly indicate their intention as a damage dealing class. The opposite is true for Bard, which clearly seems designed to inflict conditions. While, Wizards and other classes maintain their flexibility.

## Conclusion
Overall, this is just an intellectual exercise I found to be a bit of fun. There&#8217;s nothing earth shattering in these numbers, but I did find a few surprises. For me, it fixes firmly the intentional design of spell effects that help me vet or design new spells and subclasses. Additionally, it helps me understand where the gaps are either as a player or when designing scenarios as a DM. Particularly, with adventure design I think it&#8217;s important to know what the distribution of options are as you need to design broadly.

The only real conclusion I have is with subclasses like the College of Scribe Wizard from Tasha&#8217;s. I excluded that from my own games because I thought the ability to change damage type was too powerful and went against the class concepts. This confirms that assessment for me, but obviously my take is in the minority if reaction online is any gauge.

Regardless, I hope you found these numbers interesting and a bit of fun as well. Now get out there and run some great games.

Handling failure is something people seem to struggle with in 5th edition Dungeons & Dragons. When to fail, what happens when you do, and how to keep the game moving are constant topics of discussions. In my view, [Progressive Failure and Rising Tension]({% link _posts/2021-01-03-progressive-failures-and-rising-tension-in-5th-edition.md %}) is a very useful technique, but it&#8217;s just one of many in the DMs toolbox. As a discussion topic, people often seem to misunderstand the role of failure in RPGs. Worse, a small sub-population has begun to take terms like &#8216;failing-forward&#8217; to mean failure shouldn&#8217;t be possible. So taking a moment to consider the options and tools available can make even failure a fun experience in TTRPGs.

## Failing to Fail

The first order problem many DMs have with failure is introducing it at the wrong time. Mystery scenarios are a great example of this, where players must uncover a clue to move the game forward. Likewise, an NPC might need to be influenced to allow the plot to progress. While DMs might think this is a moment of tension that needs a skill roll, these are exactly the kinds of situations you do NOT want to roll for. Anything that can bring a game to a stop shouldn&#8217;t be subject to failure.

_**Players should always have the minimal information and access they need to advance the story.**_ Never gate the critical path for an adventure behind a roll. So yes, this means if the players show up or make any effort at all, they get the information they need to get to advance things one step. However, it&#8217;s important to realize that this is the **_absolute minimum_** information or access they need. Artful use of skills by the players should let them advanced in a strong position. Indeed the DM and player should work together to discover options for these additional actions. But there should always be a path forward in an adventure, even if it&#8217;s a hard one.

## Why Fail?

Risk is at the heart of adventure and acknowledging **_failure with appropriate consequences in an important dynamic in TTRPGs_**. Additionally, how a character fails can itself be an important element for driving adventures forward. With this in mind, DMs have several tools available to handle failure and keep the game flowing. Among these:

  * Matt Colville&#8217;s Running the Game series. In particular <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1zaNJrXi5Y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Many Fail States</a> discusses different ways to handle failure. Also, some reflection on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q8bVPpc84A" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Catastrophic Failure</a> in games acknowledges that sometimes you just have to accept failure.
  * My aforementioned [Progressive Failure and Rising Tension]({% link _posts/2021-01-03-progressive-failures-and-rising-tension-in-5th-edition.md %}) creates an interactive and dynamic system to allow players to **_manage failure through rising stakes and increasing tension_**.
  * Success at a Cost is a concept I first encountered in the FATE system and is reiterated in Chapter 8 of the DMG. It essentially allows DMs to **_turn failures into a success but add some complication_** or require a follow on check or action.
  * Degrees of Failure in Chapter 8 of the DMG scales failure based on the margin of failure. This **_emphasises spectacular failure as a dramatic vehicle_**.
  * Also, there is a concept called &#8220;Failing Forward&#8221; that&#8217;s been kicking around longer than I can remember. There are several different but the core allows players to try to continue by trying something different. **_Failing Forward is an opportunity to succeed by other means._**

## Conclusion 

**Failure is as valuable an outcome as success in TTRPGs.** So having options in mind for how to manage failure in interesting ways is valuable for DMs. A mistaken idea seems to be leaking into some sub-cultures in 5e, who take the position that failure shouldn&#8217;t be an option. This is a grave mistake, what they should be saying is that **_failure shouldn&#8217;t be an end_**. The game is at it&#8217;s best when the players can transform the world through their actions. Transformation can happen through success or failure.  **Regardless of success or failure, the best outcome is something fun or interesting**.

Now get out there and run some great games.

title: April 2021 Experimental House Rules

description: |
  Experimental 5th edition house rules for Defense and Grappling to provide more options during play. 
categories:
  - RPG Resources
---
Like most 5th edition Dungeons & Dragons DMs, I&#8217;m constantly tinkering with the rules in hopes of improving the experience at the table. But it takes a bit of time and testing before I consider an idea worthy of officially adding to my game. As such, I&#8217;ve been testing out some ideas on <a href="https://www.twitter.com/optionalrule" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter </a>for feedback. These are the various rules I&#8217;ve thrown out for feedback during up through the end of April 2021. After a time, if they seem worthwhile I&#8217;ll officially add them to <a href="https://optionalrule.com/2021/02/10/my-current-5e-house-rules/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">my own house rules</a> list.

## Defense

  * You may use your reaction to use the Dodge action when an attack has been declared against you, but before the results have been rolled. When you do so, you may only use the Dodge, Hide, Help, Dash, or Disengage action on your next turn.

### Comments So Far

My motivation here is to create slightly more dynamic options in combat. In particular this rule would benefit intelligent group base combat. Additionally it would mitigate the devastation of a single high damage Big Bad Evil Guy (BBEG) attack. This being more common in many adventures now. Taken together, the intent would be to have another option to manage combat though choices.

The overall feedback has been positive on this. One notable commenters thought this would give too many options to power gamers to cheese in and out of combat. However, I&#8217;m not sure disadvantage is as much protection as people think. In particular, it benefits characters with high ACs the most, but they are less likely to be inclined to use it. So, for my part the theory seems solid here, the feedback generally positive enough to think about testing this in my game.

### Grappling

  * You may use your Bonus Action to perform Help against a creature you are grappling.
  * If you are able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, you can replace one of them with an attempt to Escape a Grapple.
  * Every character starts with The Grappler feat.

### Comments So Far

Like the defensive options above, my thinking here is again to provide some more dynamic options in combat. Currently, grapple is used to control someones movement and has no option to pin anyone. I believe the logic is that pinning someone is &#8216;winning&#8217; and that is already handle in Hitpoints. However, I think it could be fun and return some potions to anyone in melee.

The feedback here was overwhelmingly positive. Several commenters replied with <a href="https://thinkdm.org/2018/06/16/grappling/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">house rules of their own</a>, many using some mix of these options already. Again, the theory seemingly solid and feedback being good, this is definitely moving to testing at my table.

## Request for More Feedback

If you find any of these house rules interesting or have thoughts, please hit me up on Twitter with any comments. If you try any of these out at your table please let me know how it goes. In the months ahead I&#8217;ll try to add additional features with rolled up house rules for that period. Perhaps I&#8217;ll return with feedback from testing on these as well.

Our site migration is now complete!  This should mean a much better and faster experience for everyone visiting the site.  You will have noticed it's been a bit quiet around here and this has been the reason.  The previous wordpress site was just too slow and solutions to make it faster were either too expensive or as difficult as switching hosts.  Given this is a content oriented blog and doesn't need a lot of scripting, I decided to switch over to building the site on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){: target="_blank"} and hosting in [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/){: target="_blank"}.

I'm limited by time and skills like everyone but I try hard to keep the site accessible, responsive, and performant so I'm most proud of the accessibility and performance metrics I've been able to achieve.  Below is the lighthouse results from parsing the site. See lighthouse results screenshot below as of today.

If you have any trouble with the site or notice any problems please tag or DM me on twitter and I hope you enjoy the new site!

title: On Die Averages and Hit Points in 5e
date: 2021-06-22 09:32
category: Analysis
author: Scott Turnbull
description: A breakdown of how we arrive at die result average numbers, and how that can cause errors in rolling HP and designing monsters.
image: /assets/img/skillcheck-480x363.jpg
---
I've had a few conversations in the passing months about average values on dice and how that relates to hit points in 5e. Word of warning, this is about to lean hard into some nerd stuff.  However, as esoteric as this may seem, it directly effects monster design and play frequently. The biggest impact it seems to have is when people try to anticipate the outcome of a roll, worse if they design a rule around it. Also, this can result in either getting player hit points or monster hit points wrong when using average results.  The solution isn't as complex as this is going to make it seem, I'm just laying out the specifics so it's all apparent.

**aside** I generated some of these examples out of a Jupyter Notebook, which you can run online yourself through [this link](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Streamweaver/DnDNotebook/0fe60184a44f012f10b67873958e1752bd8f5341?filepath=Stat%20Generation.ipynb){:target="_blank"}.

## Dice Averages

A common point of confusion for people are the values given for averages on various dice.  People see the average of 1d6 listed at 3.5 or 4 and seem confused as some expect the value to be 3. This is a common logical error people make because they are just dividing 6 by 2 in their head and getting 3, but that's now what an average is.  An average is the sum of all possible results divided by the total number of values. In this case 1 through 6. Lets demonstrate below:

### D8 Done Wrong
This is an example of the math where people can go wrong.  Just dividing by 2 isn't an average and has the effect of assuming 
zero is included in the set of numbers, obviously that isn't true.  (Even on a d10, as the 0 usually represents 10)
{% include imageframe.html
  figure_class="float-end ms-4"
  src="/assets/img/skillcheck-480x363.jpg"
  alt="A group of adventurers leaning over a table, seemingly confused by a map they are looking at"
  height="363" width="480"
  caption="Image credit Wizards of the Coast"
 %}
```python
# Quick pandas code
# Using incorrect assumptions on 1d8
d8_wrong = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
d8w = pd.Series(d8_wrong)
d8w.mean()
```
    > mean     4.000000

### D8 Done Right
```python
# The correct way, listing only actual results on the die.
d8_right = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
d8 = pd.Series(d8_right)
d8.mean()
```
    > mean     4.50000


This same pattern is repeated for every die type in the game. (i.e. 1d8, 1d10 ...).  Obviously a die can't roll a half value, 
so on any single result the value for average is rounded to the nearest, which is 5 in this case. That's how the average
roll on 1d8 is determined to be a 5.

## Single Rolls vs Multiple Dice Rolls

It's important to understand that while the average applies to a single die roll, it is not so when totaling multiple dice.  That is to say that the average of 3d6 is not 12 (3 * 4) but 11 (3 * 3.5 rounded up).  This difference introduces some confusion between determining average player hit points and average monster hit points.  The TLDR answer is that players calculate hit points discretely every level, while monsters are just determined at their CR. (Though frankly if you're a
TLDR kind of person, I don't know how you got down here)

## The confusion of Hit Points

In using these values, a bit of confusion comes in when we start to talk about how average Player Hit Points are
calculated as opposed to how average Monster Hit Points are determined.  The general difference is that player Hit
Points are calculated discreetly per level, whereas Monster Hit Points are just a sum of the average.

This is less confusing than it sounds and just means that players add the total of a hit die rolled at each level, while
monsters are just a quick sum of all their hit dice.  Taking the example of 1d8 for player hit points, they use the max
value at 1st level, so this is 8. If the player takes the average value, that means every level thereafter they would
add the average of 1d8, which is 4.5.  Since 4.5 isn't an actual value on 1d8 they round up; this is one of the
exceptions to the rounding rules in 5e.

### Example Average Player Hit Points

Lets start with an example that assumes a 5th level player with a +1 con mod. They apply the max roll at 1st level, then
add the average value of the HD rounded up at each subsequent level, and add 5 for their con bonus.


```python
player_hp = d8.max() + 4.0 * np.ceil(d8.mean()) + 5.0
player_hp
```
    33.0

Since the average of 4.5 is rounded up each roll to 5, this gives players taking the average hit points every level a
slight mathematical advantage over players who roll *on average*. However, the rolled set is so low and variance so high
that real world results are going to differ on a character by character basis.

A house rule I use in my own games is that players can either take the average hit points per level *OR* roll, but they
all have to choose the same method.  I also allow the to reroll any 1s. This creates an interesting social dynamic for
me as a DM.  This feels good for the players and is about the same in terms of the average expected roll, the mean of 1d8 shifts only from 4.5 to 4.93 and both round up to 5.  However there is a *slight* decrease in the chance of a low result and the same chance of a high result so the low end risk is a bit more shallow.

```python
d8_house_rule_values = [4.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
d8_house_rule = pd.Series(d8_house_rule_values)
d8_house_rule.max() + 4.0 * np.ceil(d8_house_rule.mean()) + 5.0
```
    33.0

However, it's not so simple from a players point of view.  Perceptions of agency, risk vs reward, and the gamblers
fallacy all combine to make an interesting party debate. They **feel** a sense of tension about this choice, and as if 
something good was given them, which I think is generally good for a game.  The metagame benefit I get as a DM is that 
this gives the players something to debate right out of the gate in a new campaign. Which means they start working out how to negotiate as a party
immediately.

### Example Average Monster Hit Points

The average monster hit points are much more simple.  However, the difference in how these are determined and how player
average hit points are determined causes some confusion. In this case we don't worry about determining the actual hit
points at each level or maxing out at first.  Monsters aren't supposed to be that complex.  Therefore, all we do is
multiply the average hit die value by the number of monster HD.

For consistency, lets take a Bugbear as an example. They are 5d8 HD creature with a +1 con mod, but the average hit
points will be different from that of a player character.

```python
bugbear_hp = 5.0 * d8.mean() + 5.0
np.floor(bugbear_hp)
```
    27.0

# Conclusion
 That seems like a lot but it's really just expressing the core ideas about why some misunderstandings arise and design faults creep in.  Once you get the right concept framed in your head it's not all that difficult but walking through the details can help some folks understand.  Having had this conversation several times recently, I thought I'd take the quick code I used during one of those discussions to throw up a blog post.

title: Gritty Healing & Survival in 5e

category: RPG Resources
author: Scott Turnbull

description: My simple gritty healing rules for 5e DnD to attend healing and add strategic gameplay.
image: /assets/img/camping_party_475x633.jpg
---

The heroic playstyle of 5e D&D is a lot of fun, but it's focused on the encounter for resource management and pacing. Sometimes players want to break things up with more of a gritty or survivalist style. This means adding gameplay elements that focus on attrition, strategic resource management, mitigation, and lean into the fragile nature of health. In other words, it extends gameplay into longer term campaign elements, rather than containing it to individual encounters. As a result of Matt Colville's recent twitch hangout, I was inspired to write down my own thoughts on gritty rules for 5e.

***Important Side Note:*** Gritty play is sometimes pushed with a sense of elitism. This is a silly  and as it's just a style of play. Keep that in mind. If you choose this style of play, the game is inherently going to get much more about tracking and managing resources. There is nothing wrong if that style of play is not for you. However, if you enjoy it, these rules should give you something to sink your teeth into.

## Don't We Have This Already?
Discussion of gritty mechanics and survival rules in 5e is an evergreen topic. A quick google search will turn up a number grim dark, gritty, or other survival rules. However, I never thought these hit the right spot of focus or depth for my own campaigns. Even the 5e DMG has a set of ***Gritty Realism rules*** to use that just extends short rests to once a day, and long-rests to once a week. Rather than providing a different style of play, the gritty realism rules just make everything take longer. Therefore, they are neither gritty nor realistic. 

What I'm presenting here is closer to the Slow Natural Healing rules in Chapter 9 of the DMG.

**A Quick Note on Realism:** A frequent mistake people make is to assume this is an attempt to make 5e more realistic or simulationist. It is not. This just makes mechanics about survival and health management more of a central gameplay element.

## The Rules

{% include imageframe.html
  figure_class="float-end ms-4 clearfix"
  src="/assets/img/camping_party_475x633.jpg"
  alt="A mixed party of six adventurers resting by the campfire deep in the woods.  Two appear to be wounded or exhausted."
  width="475" height="633"
  caption="Image credit Wizards of the Coast"
 %}
 Where noted these house rules replace the standard 5e rules.

### Natural Healing
Short and Long Rest healing is no longer used, otherwise rests work as normal. Instead, players may only spend Hit Dice (HD) to heal at the end of a Long Rest. Also, HD are spent separately to heal ability scores, drain, and damage. Additionally players roll to recover spent Hit Die instead of recovering half of their HD at the end of a long rest. (*You knew that was the rule right?*) In this way, extended combat and stress have a larger impact and tend to grind characters down more.

The Long Rest sequence is as follows:
* Roll to recover spent HD
* Choose to spend HD on healing ability damage, drain, or to recovery hit points.
* Modify any HD roll by the recovery conditions.

#### Recovering Spent HD
Hit Dice are recovered by rolling a DC 13 Constitution check for each spent HD at the end of a long rest, before any healing. Disadvantage may be imposed under harsh conditions, with inadequate shelter, or if unable to rest. Likewise advantage may be granted under good recovery conditions and medical care, such as at a sanctuary or house of healing.

#### Spending HD on Healing
Players choose to spend their HD to heal ability loss, drain, or damage separately as follows: 

* One Hit Die to recover one point of ability score loss. 
* One Hit Die roll to recover drain.
* One Hit Die roll to heal damage.

#### Modifying Hit Die Rolls
Recovery assumes you have access to good shelter, food, sleep, and care. For each one of these conditions not met, the type of Hit Die rolled for recovery is reduced by one. This means 1d12 becomes 1d10, 1d10 a 1d8, and so forth down to a minimum of 1 point. See Chapter 5 in the DMG for more on conditions and survival.

**Shelter:** This assumes a restful and clean environment such as a private inn room or residence. In the wilderness this requires a DC 13 Wisdom (Survival) check with adequate supplies like tents, made with disadvantage setup or find a shelter with no equipment. A single character may make this roll for a group up to their skill bonus in size.

**Good Food:** A hot meal or good quality food is needed for healing. Characters can use the [Foraging Rules](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dmg/adventure-environments#Foraging){:target="_blank"} from Chapter 5 of the DMG if they need to find food in the wilderness. Finding *quality* food with foraging is difficult.  Roll twice when foraging and if both rolls are successful, the food is of high enough quality to satisfy this requirement.  Otherwise it is simply enough to keep you from starving.

**Sleep**: Sleep or meditation is required as normal for your race. Without adequate shelter or if interrupted with combat this may require an individual DC 13 Constitution (Survival) check to satisfy this requirement. This roll may be modified or made at disadvantage under harsh conditions.

**Medical Care:** Having proper care is important for a speedy recovery. Characters proficient in the Medicine skill may make a DC 13 Wisdom (Medicine) check to provide proper medical care to themselves or others. The DC is increased by 2 for every patient over the first and is made at disadvantage without proper medical supplies. 

### Starvation and Water

As mentioned in the ***Good Food*** topic above, food is essential for survival and healing. Additionally, characters may suffer exhaustion from starvation or dehydration. The rules covering Food and Water in Chapter 8 of the PHB, and Foraging rules from Chapter 5 of the DMG, should cover this well.  Games that need more harsh survival conditions can simply modify the DCs as appropriate.

## Other Considerations

All-in-all a gritty playstyle will have extended rules over a number of sub-systems. These can be as expansive or brief as fits your campaign. However, I recommend starting with these gritty healing rules and see how they land with your players (*after* getting buy-in) and expanding from there if it seems fun. If so, you may also want to consider other expanded rules or modifications.

**Limiting Hit Points:** 5e does a better job of doing damage than most people give it credit for. However, there are various OSR rules for hit points you may want to consider if this is right for you. There is a different option that I think works better than limited hit points, that is limited healing.  **I will make a follow-up post about this later in the week** but a complimentary rule is something that requires players to spend HD to receive healing, otherwise it heals 1 pt. This prevents turning the cleric into a heal-bot and more.

**Infection & Disease:** Using the disease rules from Chapter 8 of the DMG, you could decide to include infection from wounds in your game. I think this is for groups on the extreme end of gritty survival games but it's a consideration. Use the rules for Sewer Plague to govern any infection.

**Lowering Ability Scores:** Many gritty games lean into randomly generated ability scores rather than having everyone in the group easily reaching maximum humanoid potential. So, choose a generation method that is right for you. Additionally, you may want to consider doing away with Ability Score Increases (ASI) and using Feats as the only option. This can add more variety and customization and some still come with a +1 ASI.

**Spells:** Gritty play puts more burden on spells and spell casters. Some DMs may consider banning or modifying spells like Goodberry, Create Water, Healing Spirit, and Tiny Hut.

## Campaigns
Introducing a system like this significantly impacts the pacing of campaigns and challenge of encounters. This system works better for campaigns with modular encounters and opportunities to manage rest and recovery. Therefore, campaigns like Lost Mines of Phandelver, or Rime of the Frostmaiden may be better suited. Campaigns like Out of the Abyss or Tomb of Annihilation may require a lot of modification by the DM or be a poor fit for this style of play.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
<i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> Watch for Part 2 of this series to address Gritty Healing and Spells, Potions, and Abilities later in the week.
</div>

## Conclusion
Gritty rules aren't for everyone, but can be a fun variation on your 5e play or suited for some groups playstyles. To be successful, you need full buy-in from everyone in the group and have to enjoy the management and level of detail that goes into this kind of play. Those that enjoy it can welcome the challenge of planning through recovery or mitigating for loss. DMs would do well to provide players both opportunities to shine, and interesting challenges to overcome through planning and preparation. To be sure, these rules are usually not for the faint of heart or play groups that don't like getting lost in the details.  Additionally, this playstyle is better suited for tier one and two play. However, most games happen in those tiers anyway and if you're looking for higher tier play, gritty rules were probably never a consideration.

Now go out there and run some great games.

description: Part 2 of my Gritty Healing and Survival Rules for 5e address mechanics for spells and potions.
image: /assets/img/silverstars_by_anthonyfoti-wotc_475x594.jpg
---

Earlier in the week I posted some rules for [Gritty Healing & Survival in 5e]({% link _posts/2021-06-27-gritty-healing-and-survival-rules.md %}). These work for group looking for that kind of long-term resource management and play. However, it leaves a bit of a gap when it comes to healing spells and magic.  In fact, most gritty mechanics suffer from the problem of setting up a system for persistent injuries, then introduce magic that lets you skip past it. Also, it suffers from the problem of turning the cleric into the heal-bot for a party, making sit out of the action during encounters to heal everyone later. So having some way to align the leaning mechanic with the core idea of recovery as a central design principle is important. Without it, you end up with the same effect as healing overnight but force the healing PC to burn all their resources and sit most encounters out.

I expect this option to be controversial. It flies in the face of the conventional expectation of drinking a wheelbarrow full of healing potions, and it makes the pacing and of games much more volatile.

## Skin In the Game
As it is, healing is just something that falls out of the sky. Be it divine intervention, alchemy, or some other magic.  It costs the recipient nothing and can continue indefinitely if the party has resources. With these rules, healing spells cost the recipient something, limiting how much they can benefit from spells and abilities. That has the effect of involving the receiving player in the decision and managing healing as a resource as well.  Lore wise the premise is simple, the body can only take so much and flesh has it's limits.  It is a staple of many narratives to have the healer provide some limited help, then back away with a "I've done all I can, the rest is up to them".  This rules brings that lore into play.

### The Rule
A recipient must spend one Hit Die to gain the benefit of a healing spell, potion, or ability. Meaning they must agree to being healed and mark off one of their own Hit Die to gain the benefit. A healing spell, potion, or ability may still be used on a willing target with no Hit Die to spend or who does not wish to spend a HD. This includes targets who are unconscious. In cases where no HD is spent by the target, the healing works but only does 1 point.

### Notes on Specific Spells and Abilities

* Healing over multiple rounds, such as with ***Healing Spirit***, costs the recipient 1 HD per round.
* ***Goodberry:*** Recipients can only benefit from the effects of one goodberry per long rest. It counts as food to avoid starvation but does not qualify as ***Good Food*** for the recovery rules in Gritty Healing & Survival.
* ***Lay On Hands:*** The recipient must spend a Hit Die to gain the benefit of multiple points of healing.  Otherwise, they can receive one point of healing per action without spending a Hit Die.
* ***Tiny Hut:*** Works as normal except it does not provide a magical barrier against damage or intrusion. For purposes of Shelter it counts as having proper equipment and cancels out environmental conditions as per the spell description.  
* ***Lesser Restoration:*** No longer automatically cures any disease. Instead, it gives the target an immediate saving throw against the disease at advantage. 
* Spells that removes conditions behaves normally in terms of condition removal but rules above take precedence if there are additional results.
* Temporary HP are unaffected by these rules.
* Fighters can use ***Second Wind*** without spending Hit Die, but they are considered temporary hit points that last until the end of the next Long Rest.

## Mixing and Matching
While I'm proposing this system for the Gritty Healing & Survival Rules I published earlier in the week, it can be used with a number of systems. There are other gritty or slow healing systems in use this can either be used with directly or with slight modification.  Half HD healing and only healing half max hp on long rest, fixed HP per rest, or any number of other systems are all skipped past with normal healing.  These rules could work well with any of those systems to free up the healing PC to participate in the encounter and keep wounds meaningful. In a few weeks I'll publish a simpler system for tracking wounds this can work with as well.

### Alternative Tracking
The core goal here is to limit healing so it doesn't overturn any long term healing rules, and doesn't relegate healing classes to heal-bots. Using the Hit Die mechanic is just a way to track and bound the amount of healing being done.  If you are not a fan of the Hit Die mechanics you could simply choose another method. Proficiency bonus times per day, half level, fixed number, or something wild like each successive healing attempt per day is less effective.  Any of these approaches could work if you keep the core concept in mind, that bounding healing is critical a gritty or long term healing mechanic.

## Conclusion
These rules close a bit loophole in the original Gritty Healing and Survival rules as presented.  It further reduces the recovery rate of players but serves two purposes. First it doesn't create a situation where healing casters are holding onto all their spell slots to heal everyone. While it can be fun to know that you are keeping the party up and running, this frees them up more to participate directly in encounters. Second, it maintains the long-term management aspects by keeping a *Hit Die Economy* in the campaign timescale. Lastly, it encourages downtime and other activities not focused on the combat encounter.

Now go out there and run some great games.

description: A set of 5e house rules that make journeys fun by limiting long rests on the road and providing some rules for camps.
---

Perilous journeys are a mainstay of fantasy literature and adventure, yet 5e provides little game play in the way of travel and discovery.  This is primarily because the system focuses on encounters per day, which limits long form narrative game elements.  First, the long rest reset means encounters or delays seem little more than annoying distractions. Second, characters have little in the way of meaningful game play to engage them in travel. or interact with one another. These rules present a few simple modifications to add some game play spice back into your journeys to help make the exploration pillar exciting again.

  caption="Image credit <a href='https://www.artstation.com/artwork/ykeEaQ' target='_blank'>Alex Wilton</a>"
 %}

Many of these rules draw inspiration from the very fine Journeys mechanic from Adventures in Middle Earth, which is unfortunately no longer published.  While mechanically different in places the core themes remain, and I recommend reading those rules for further inspiration.

## Havens & Rests

Characters may only gain the benefits of a Long Rest at a Haven or Base Camp. Havens are **secure** locations with strong **shelter**. enough **supplies** and room to rest and study. So manors, well-furnished houses, or Inn rooms rated Comfortable or above work well as Havens. While temporary camps, common rooms, or unsafe locations may allow sleep or recovery from exhaustion, they are not adequate to gain the benefits of a Long Rest. However, with the right supplies and skills, characters may be able to setup Base Camps in the field that allow a proper Long Rest. Meaning the core of game play on the road is managing your supplies, camps, and connecting with settlements in a region to travel in a way that allows you to either move freely or sustain operations, but not both.

### Base Camps
Base camps are temporary locations that can be secured and setup to allow for long rests. Setting up a base camp requires a full workday, proper equipment and supplies, and a DC 15 Wisdom (Survival) check. The check can be made by a single character on behalf of the party, or as a Group Check by the party.  (See Chapter 7 of the PHB for more on Group Checks).  A success means the location can be used to take long rests, or a failure means they may try again the next day.  Also, a DM should ask the group for one major feature of their Base Camp they can invoke during encounters or play.  This should be something that makes sense given the location and provides them flavor during play. Examples of features might be "Close to game", "Protected on three sides by a stream", "Hidden from sight", "Shelter from storms", "Warm (or cool)", "Hard to reach", or anything that adds interesting flavor.

Without proper equipment, or in hostile territory like a dungeon, a base camp can only be setup by someone proficient in the Survival skill and the roll is made with disadvantage.  

After a major disruptive event like an attack or disaster, have the party immediately make the same roll to maintain the camp.  On a failure, the camp or location is damaged or compromised in a way that means it must be rebuilt. 

### Sleep, Medical Care, & Hearty Meals.
Characters who rest for eight hours outside of a Haven or Basecamp may still gain a few benefits provided they have the right conditions, supplies and skills. Characters recover one level of exhaustion if able to properly sleep, meditate, or the equivalent for their race. Additionally, they may recover one spent Hit Die through either medical care, or a hearty meal. Medical care requires spending one use of a healing kit and succeeding on a DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check from someone proficient in Medicine.  A hearty meal can be prepared by someone proficient in either Survival or with Cook's Utensils by passing a DC 15 Wisdom (Survival) check. Hearty meals also require fresh or high quality ingredients. This means rations, conjured food, or Goodberries will keep you fed but are not sufficient enough to recover a Hit Die.  Characters may only recover a maximum of one spent Hit Die outside of a long rest.

## Travel Pace

With limited opportunities for long rests, the cumulative effects of life on the road become part of the adventure. Speed of travel depends mostly on the type of terrain being traversed, conditions along the way, chosen path, as well as the fickle nature of the environment.  The normal movement pace depends on the type of terrain as referenced below.  

| Pace    | Speed | Daily | DC |Terrain                |
|---------|:-----:|:-----:|:--:|-----------------------|
| Fast    | 4 mph | 32 mi | -  |-                      |
| Normal  | 3 mph | 24 mi | 10 |Grasslands, plains, wastes etc.|
| Slow    | 2 mph | 16 mi | 15 |Forests, hills, tundra, sand desert, etc.    |
| Crawl   | 1 mph | 8 mi  | 20 |Mountains, swamps, jungle, etc. |
{: .table .table-striped .table-hover}

Paved roads make terrain one level faster, with a maximum pace of Fast.  Wagons make terrain one level slower and cannot travel in terrain that would slow to more than a crawl.  Difficult terrain applies to these paces as normal in Chapter 8 of the PHB. Special movement types or mounts such as pegasus or griffon, are handled as appropriate with guidance from the DMG.

**None of these elements interfere with the Rangers Natural Explorer ability.** While pace effects the base movement speed, difficult terrain still applies.

## Conclusion of Part 1

These rules are a simple way to turn what had been disjointed day by day travel into a continuous adventure about life on the road.  It provides ways for players to engage with the environment and connects planning and travel to the greater story as it unfolds through meaningful actions and outcomes.

When writing this I decided to split it into two parts.  This part deals with what is essentially, the pacing element of travel. In the next part I will talk about how the party can interact with each other the road, as well as some simple modifications to healing and recovery.  So keep an eye out for that next week.

Now get out there and run some great games.

description: Adding journey actions to make travel exciting again in 5th edition Dungeons & Dragons.
---

Exciting journeys in 5th edition engage the party and give them meaningful actions as part of the adventure.  Last week I posted [Perilous Journey's Part 1]({% link _posts/2021-07-13-perilous-journeys-in-5e-p1.md %}), which turns travel into a series of encounters like any other dungeon. This week, I'll look at defining some ways that party members can take meaningful actions during journeys.  These **Journey Actions** provide gameplay for the travel experience, as well as create dependencies between members of the party. 

As with any rule or option, use when it add something to the game  and move along when it doesn't.

## Journey Actions

When traveling, a character may take one Journey Action as part of travel.  Any actions taken during travel should be chosen prior to the start of travel. Multiple characters may attempt the same action and each roll separately. This has the same roll mechanic as advantage but they each apply their individual skill bonus. Additionally, The DM may want to consider the role of proficiency in these rules. Optionally, they may only allow a character to take a journey action if proficient in an indicated skills. 

**Terrain Pace and DC Table** 

| Pace    | Speed | Daily | DC |Terrain                |
|---------|:-----:|:-----:|:--:|-----------------------|
| Fast    | 4 mph | 32 mi | -  |-                      |
| Normal  | 3 mph | 24 mi | 10 |Grasslands, plains, wastes etc.|
| Slow    | 2 mph | 16 mi | 15 |Forests, hills, tundra, sand desert, etc.    |
| Crawl   | 1 mph | 8 mi  | 20 |Mountains, swamps, jungle, etc. |

### Forage

{% include imageframe.html

  alt="A road through lonely woods.  Two mean guard a horse drawn wagon at the front and rear with bow and spear."

  caption="Image credit <a href='https://www.artstation.com/artwork/baBQrr' target='_blank'>Kirk Langsea</a>"
 %}

Foraging along the way for harvestable plants, or small game allows parties to eat hearty means.  Rather than keeping track of day-to-day rations in a group, this form of foraging gathers ingredients for a **Hearty Meal**.  As mentioned in, part 1 of Perilous Journeys, a hearty meal may allow characters to recover a single hit die from after sleeping for eight hours when unable to take a long rest.

Characters harvesting use the rules in Chapter 5 of the PHB and roll ***Wisdom (Survival)***, at +5 DC to the table presented there. Again, with this method assume the party has enough food to sustain themselves and recover exhaustion.  Instead, this type of foraging focuses on higher quality food to help recover Hit Die as per the rules above. 

Alternatively, someone foraging could opt to gather herbs or ingredients for potions instead. If so, have them roll ***Intelligence (Nature)*** at the same DC used for foraging above.  Instead of pounds of good food, they recover the equivalent gold piece worth of ingredients. See the [Summary of 5e Alchemy Rules]({% link _posts/2021-01-24-summary-of-5e-alchemy-rules.md %}) for options.

### Guide
Guiding a party involves combining your knowledge of an area’s geography, history, and conditions to choose a safe and sure route. At the start of a day's journey, the guide decides the best route and rolls either an ***Intelligence (Nature)*** or ***Intelligence (History)*** check at the DC presented on the Terrain Pace table. This roll is made with disadvantage if the guide is unfamiliar with the terrain, has no maps, or has not gathered enough information prior to travel. On a failure, the chances of a random encounter or hazard are doubled for the travel period and the party has disadvantage on any stealth checks. Parties without a guide automatically fail this check. 

### Scout
Scouting involves moving ahead of the party and using your keen senses spot danger or stealth to avoid it.  Scouts may always make active ***Wisdom (Perception)*** checks against hidden dangers.  Additionally, they can use their ***Dexterity (Stealth)*** skill to allow the entire party to avoid an encounter if the scout spotted it first. Parties staging an ambush on foes discovered by a scout have advantage on checks to catch them unaware.

### Ward
Warding uses prowess and awareness to protect the party from hazards and ambush. If a character in the party performing the warding action is not surprised during an ambush, the entire party gets advantage on their roll to avoid surprise. 

Also, when encountering a natural hazard that requires a Strength or Dexterity save, the Warder may roll ***Strength (Athletics)*** and allow a character up to 10 feet away to use that roll instead of their own save.  The warding character may allow a number of characters up to their proficiency bonus to use their roll in this way. Examples of the kinds of hazards might be falling, avoiding an avalanche, stepping into a pit or the like.

## Spicing Things Up

These rules mix well with several other house rules. By themselves they are not any more deadly or gritty than any dungeon encounter. In fact, these rules only bring journey encounters in alignment with dungeons. You can think of the entire track of a journey like a node-based set of encounters in a dungeon.

Mixing in other rules such as slower hit point recovery, or failed death saves only clearing on a long rest, should be approached with caution with a system like this. 

Additionally, consider adding more opportunities for players to interact with locals during travel. Perhaps a well to do farmer would allow the party to sleep in their comfortable barn with food or supplies, or the rules might drive the party to seek out more Inns.  The goal is to spice up journeys with more meaningful actions and choices, so encourage players to lean into that.

## Conclusion

These actions and rules imply a healthy variety of hazards and challenges during Journeys, but DMs should use their discretion. Not every journey need be a gripping adventure, and DMs may choose to pass several days at a time rather than going day by day. Choose the style that best fits the pacing and game in the moment. There are several wilderness encounter generators available on the DMs Guild, as well as sites like [DnDSpeak.com](https://www.dndspeak.com/){:target="_blank"} that offer lots of encounter ideas and tables.  I will eventually post systems here for journey-based encounters as well.

Now get out there and run some great games.

title: Sampling Random Ability Score Generation

description: Comparing different methods of random ability score generation in your 5th edition game.
---

Using randomly generated ability scores is a recurring topic on many 5e forums. Although, standard array and point buy are the most common method by far, rolled ability scores is the default method for 5e. Indeed, random ability scores were the standard for most of the history of Dungeons & Dragons,. Point buy was introduced with 3rd edition, and the Standard Array didn't come out until Xanathar's for 5th edition. While I consider standard array better for ensuring parity between players, the appeal of random ability rolls is still there for many.

Like everything in 5e, it all comes down to what you want out of it.  So, I thought it would be fun to talk about why random ability scores can be fun and what games can expect from using different methods. 

## Why Random Generation?
People can find fun in random ability scores for a few reasons. First, the feeling of discovering a character and playing within the constraints of random abilities can be exciting.  Second, players can feel this creates a more 'realistic' individual that has to deal with the hand nature as dealt them. Third, it can move the baseline of stats to create a more gritty or epic character, depending on the method selected. These can be fun, and I particularly enjoy the discovery and constraints element of rolling abilities. However, be aware that some method can create wild disparities between characters, which can ruin the fun in some groups.

**If you're thinking about using randomly generated ability scores in your game, I have one piece of advice.** Know the difference between something you like other people doing, and what those other people actually like to do. That means that the group should not only buy into something like this but be excited about it. There's a pitfall for DMs who get things into their head that they like to see the players do but ends up being no fun for the players. So, make sure to pick an option the whole party is going to enjoy when considering something like random ability score generation.

## Common Methods of Random Generation

There are several methods used to generate random abilities.  In most cases it creates a set of 6 scores the player can arrange how they like. Some versions that let players only swap a limited number of scores. A few hardcore rulesets even go so far as to keep them in the order rolled. As with anything, no way is better than another, it all comes down to what you want out if it. The most common methods are:

* 3d6 rolled for each ability. (3d6)
* 3d6 rolled 7 times and keep the highest 6. (3d6 7x-k6)
* 3d6, reroll any 1s. (3d6 r1)
* 4d6 keep the highest 3. (4d6 h3)
* 2d6+6 for each ability. (2d6+6)

### Break Down of Ranges

The first thing to understand about any random ability score generation method is the range and probability. How high and low a range of rolls can be, versus how likely any individual roll is likely to be.  Different methods produce different results and a [Distribution Curve](https://anydice.com/program/237f0){:target="_blank"} graph of the most common methods is presented below.

Common rules DMs use is to reroll abilities below a particular level, let players shift points around, or rerolling if you are below a particular score value. This kind of defeats the purpose of random abilities to me, but these are the base percentages you'll get from different methods.

{% include imageframe.html
  figure_class="clearfix"

  width="475" height="475"
  caption="Chart data compiled from <a href='https://anydice.com/program/237f0' target='_blank'>Any Dice</a>"
 %}

### The Most Common Results

While distributions curves are great, what people want to know is what the most likely set of abilities from a particular method are.  Again, since this is random it will vary but the table below presents the ideal set of stats produced from different generation methods.  Note I am presenting the Standard Array as a comparison, and that it essentially corresponds to the method for 3d6 rerolling 1s.  If a DM were just interested in shifting ability scores up or down, they could select one of these as a new standard array and avoid the random swings.  As should be apparent, these methods can produce very different types of characters.

| Method         |    |    |    |    |    |    |
| -------------- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| [2d6+6](https://anydice.com/program/237f7)        | 16 | 15 | 14 | 12 | 11 | 10 |
| [4d6 Drop lowest](https://anydice.com/program/237f6)   | 16 | 14 | 13 | 12 | 10 | 9  |
| Standard Array | 15 | 14 | 13 | 12 | 10 | 9  |
| [3d6 reroll 1s](https://anydice.com/program/237f4)  | 15 | 14 | 13 | 12 | 10 | 9  |
| [3d6 7 times, drop lowest](https://anydice.com/program/237f5)    | 14 | 13 | 12 | 11 | 9  | 8  |
| [3d6](https://anydice.com/program/237f3)           | 14 | 12 | 11 | 10 | 9  | 7  |
{: .table .table-striped .table-hover}

## The Bounded Accuracy Problem
One thing to note about ability score generation is that 5e was built heavily on the concept of 'bounded accuracy'. That is to say that the game design intends to tightly control the number of bonuses and their progression throughout the game.  So, giving characters higher or lower abilities could slightly impact gameplay difficulty. This is likely not going to be a massive issue, but a group should take this into consideration, particularly the DM when balancing encounters.  Additionally, ending up with drastically different primary ability bonuses can be a let down in a group, and the bounded accuracy problem may feel larger than it is.

## Conclusion
There is no superior method when generating ability score, it all depends on what you want.  This not only includes the ability ranges, but the mystery of what a character will be during character creation.  Generally, I prefer standard array or point buy as a DM, but I'll allow a party to select random scores if they ALL want to and agree.  I've had some fun with this in various games, notably having played a healer who rolled minimum strength, playing them as having a neuromuscular disability.  In all honesty, the striving to be heroic in the face of a setback was a lot of fun for me as it taps into my own emotions and experiences having a disability. I wouldn't want to do that in every game however, but it is fun now and again.  Regardless, it's good to know what the likely outcomes will be when choosing something like this, so I hope this post helped shed some light onto that.

Now get out there and run some great games.

title: Tavern Games - Darts for your D&D Game

description: A mini-game to simulate darts for your TTRPG play group.
---

Mini-games can be fun distraction for your players in any TTRPG campaign. Downtime or social sessions can create a lot of opportunities for this in your game. With the release of [The Wild Beyond the Witchlight](https://dnd.wizards.com/products/wild-beyond-witchlight){:target="_blank"} adventure, players have asking about mini-games to use.  So I thought I'd share the rules for my simple mini-game for Darts.

In the most simple case, a series of opposed DEX (**Athletics**) checks will suffice. However, I ended up with a play group that were Dart enthusiast and wanted a full on mini-game.  So I'm sharing the simple rules I used in hopes it might have some use in your sessions.


{% include imageframe.html
  figure_class="float-end ms-4"
  src="/assets/img/Gaston-Dart-Board_600x400.jpg"
  alt="A dart board in a wooden frame and chalkboard for score mounted on an old tavern wall."
  width="600" height="400"
  caption="Image from Gaston's Tavern by Disney."
 %}

## The Rules
A player rolls 2 separate color D20s, the first represents the segment of the board, the second the ring.  Like normal darts the segment the dart lands in (the number rolled on the die) determines the score. If you're not familiar with darts, see the diagram below and it should make sense. The final score for the throw is modified by the result of the ring die like so.

* 5 - double the score
* 10 - triple the score
* 15 - 25 pt Outer Bullseye if the segment die is above 10.
* 20 - 50 pt Inner Bullseye if the segment die is a 20.

The player may modify either or both die results by a total of their ranged attack modifier.

### Example

Beau takes a turn at darts, rolls an 8 on the segment die, and a 13 on the ring die. They choose to user their 7 ranged attack bonus to add 3 to the segment die to make it a 12, and 2 to the ring die to make it a 15.  That's an Inner Bullseye for 25 pts!

## Conclusion
This level of mini-game isn't for everyone, but groups looking to play out some downtime may enjoy it.  The system is simple enough to play out, but isn't intended to be a balance game on it's own.  It works best when players move along quickly, perhaps with a favorite libation, and make quick choices.  So keep it moving and have them create some character moments.  Now get out there and run some great games.

---

Greetings, adventurers! It's always exciting when the landscape of our beloved game, Dungeons & Dragons (D&D), shifts and morphs, opening up new pathways for our collective imagination. The [latest errata](https://media.wizards.com/2020/dnd/downloads/PH-Errata.pdf){:target="_blank"} issued for D&D 5E has brought such a change, one that holds significant implications for how we understand and play our favorite tabletop RPG. Among a host of clarifications, there is one change that stands out: the removal of alignment references for races in the Player's Handbook.

Now, for the uninitiated, 'alignment' in D&D is a system that describes a character's ethical and moral compass. Traditionally, certain alignments have been associated with specific races in the game. For example, orcs might be labeled as 'chaotic evil', while elves are typically 'chaotic good'. This recent errata has removed these broad-stroke associations, and I believe this change is a valuable one.

While some fans have voiced concerns that this is a mere marketing move or an unnecessary change, I'd argue it's a thoughtful, inclusive adjustment. It aims to disentangle our fantasy world-building from harmful real-world biases, and in doing so, it allows for a more nuanced approach to creating our characters and our realms.

The beauty of D&D is in its diversity and freedom, and the opportunity to create a truly unique world. Encouraging players, especially the rising tide of newcomers to the hobby, to break away from stereotypical associations opens up a world of possibilities. It allows DMs to create the world they envision, rather than working to undo preconceived notions.

The Player's Handbook is about empowering players to create the character they want to play, not prescribing to them a specific alignment based on their chosen race. And while it could be argued that these alignment associations might still have a place in the DMG or the Monster Manual, I'd say it's important to remember that even these resources are guides, not hard rules. Each game's setting is a unique tapestry woven by the DM and players, and this errata allows that tapestry to be even richer and more varied.

The rest of the errata presents a number of welcome clarifications that will surely enhance our gameplay, but it's the alignment reference removal that truly feels long overdue. This change not only reflects a more modern and inclusive approach to fantasy gaming, but it also respects the creative autonomy of players and DMs alike.

Here's to the continued evolution of our beloved game, and the endless adventures that await us. Roll high, friends!

title: Injured Condition For Lasting Damage

description: A simple and quick lasting injuries system for DnD based on the Exhausted playtest.

Injuries in Dungeons & Dragons are important for two reasons: they add realism to the game and they can be used to add humor. By making injuries last longer, it gives the players a sense of realism and danger that they may not feel if they simply healed back up to full hit points after every battle. It also allows for some interesting role-playing opportunities, such as a character with a permanent limp trying to negotiate a difficult terrain. Finally, it can be fun to see how creative the players can be in dealing with their injuries and add depth to a game.

With the release of the [Exhausted condition in the new OneDnD Playtest](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/one-dnd/expert-classes/kpx0MvyfBGHe0XKk/UA2022-Expert-Classes.pdf?icid_source=house-ads&icid_medium=crosspromo&icid_campaign=playtest2){:target="_blank"}, injuries can be tracked in a way common with other game rules.

### Injured [Condition]
While you are subject to the Injured Condition you experience the following effects:

**Levels of Injury.** This Condition is cumulative. Each time you receive it, you gain 1 level of injury. You die if your injury level exceeds 10. 

**d20 Rolls Affected.** When you make a d20 Test, you subtract your injury level from your d20 roll.

**Spell Save DCs Affected.** Subtract your injury level from the Spell save DC of any Spell you cast.

**Gaining the Condition.** A character gains 1 level of Injury when they return from 0 hp if they have failed a death save or if they are damage by more than half their max hit points from a single source of damage. 

**Recovering.** Immediately after finishing a Long Rest the character may make a DC 10 Constitution Test, removing 1 level of injury on a success. Characters who fail by rolling a 1 gain an additional injury level. Another character may make a Medicine Test DC 10 + Injury level to give the character advantage when rolling for recovery. When their injury level reaches 0, the character is no longer injured.

## Considerations
Adding a new track for damage needs to be delt with smoothly in relation to other elements of the system. Natural healing and medicine checks are addressed in the condition. This leaves how you might interact with the design and intention of existing classes, spells, and magic items in the game.

### Design & Running

While managing survival and risk elements can be fun with the right player, there are a few things a DM should be cautious of.  First, beware of creating a "death spiral" in your encounters where negative effects lead to more negative effects.  Second, the flow of an encounter is no longer about the number of resources used, and players will need an opportunity to retreat. Third, consider how the group will best deal with the die modifications. This system is simple enough that you could either rely on the player to modify their roll, or ask the DM to modify DCs instead.  Finally, be aware that this is suited for a particular style of play and not for every player.  Talk to your group about it.

### Classes

Think about what your expectations are for classes, particularly the Warrior Group to deal with Injuries. Likely they will need some way to deal with injuries unique to their role as they are most likely to get injured. As such a Warrior Feat or class ability could be added like so.

#### Shrug it Off
A character can choose to tap their deep reserves of fortitude to avoid taking an injury level from damage.  They can use this ability once, and regain the ability to do so after a Long Rest.

### Spells

Magical healing is a reality in DnD and choosing how Injuries interact with magic is an important management tool. The trick is not to introduce a risk that you immediately negate with a too easily accessible feature. I recommend adding an effect to the Lesser Restoration spell that allows it to remove 1 level of Injury from the target.

### Magic Items

Similar to spells, healing from magic items should be considered. As with spells, I would recommend adding a single Injury level removal effect to a potion of Lesser Restoration.

## Conclusion

Lingering injuries and impact of choices beyond a single game day is one of the most discussed topics in DnD circles. It has been particularly difficult in 5e DnD because of the lack of granular minus. The playtested Exhausted condition provides an elegant way to introduce that and can easily be used for Injuries as well.  A simple status track like this does not add much overhead to the play experience, and adding a dimension of injury management can create more fun for players seeking a gritty game.  Furthermore the system provides an incremental injury system so players can look at their risk more strategically over the source of an encounter.

Now get out there and run some great games!

title: The Return of the Write Spell -  A Nostalgic Callback or Unnecessary Complexity?

description: This blog post explores the reintroduction of the Write spell in the D&D 5th edition playtest material, discussing its origins, potential purpose, and whether it adds meaningful depth or unnecessary complexity to the game.
---

As fans of Dungeons and Dragons 5th edition, we're always excited to see what new <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/one-dnd/ph-playtest-5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">playtest material</a> the developers come up with. Recently, there's been a proposed change to how wizards scribe spells into their spellbooks that has stirred up some debate in the D&D community. The change involves introducing a spell called "Scribe Spell" to handle the scribing process, a concept that harkens back to an earlier spell called "Write" from the first edition of Advanced Dungeons and Dragons. In this blog post, we'll dive into the history of these spells, their potential purpose in the 5th edition, and whether they add value or just unnecessary complexity to the game.

 %}

**A Blast from the Past: The Origins of Write and Scribe Spell**

The Write spell first appeared in the earliest editions of Advanced Dungeons and Dragons. It allowed wizards to scribe spells into their spellbooks, with the interesting twist of having a chance of failure and explosion. This risk added a sense of danger and mystery to the process of acquiring new spells, making magic feel more esoteric and unpredictable.

Over time, this mechanic was streamlined, and from 3rd edition onward, scribing spells became a simple class ability for wizards. This made the process less risky and time-consuming, allowing players to focus more on adventuring and less on managing their spellbooks.

**A Return to OSR Thinking with Scribe Spell?**

Some might argue that the introduction of the Scribe Spell in the 5th edition playtest material is an attempt to return to the Old School Renaissance (OSR) style of play, where magic was more unpredictable and dangerous. This could be seen as a nostalgic callback to the early days of D&D, offering a more challenging and immersive experience for players who yearn for the good old days.

**But Is It Necessary?**

While it's interesting to see the Scribe Spell make its debut in the playtest material as a callback to the original Write spell, its reintroduction raises the question of whether it adds meaningful depth to the game or just unnecessary complexity. It's important for playtests to be experimental and push the boundaries of the game, but not every idea should make it into the final product.

Personally, I'm all for a spell system that adds danger or interesting management options to play, but this doesn't do any of that. The Scribe Spell, in its current form, may be more of a designer's pet project rather than something that will genuinely enhance the player experience. Adding a layer of complexity and potential danger to scribing spells might seem like a fun idea on paper, but in practice, it could detract from the core gameplay and frustrate players who just want to get on with their adventures.

**Conclusion**

The introduction of the Scribe Spell in the D&D 5th edition playtest material, as a callback to the original Write spell, is an intriguing nod to the game's origins, but its practical value in the modern game is debatable. Personally, I don't see what it adds to the game. While it's great to see developers experimenting with different mechanics, it's important to recognize when a design element might not be the best fit for the current edition. The Scribe Spell is a fascinating part of D&D history, but it may be best left in the past as we continue to evolve the game and focus on what makes it truly engaging for players.

Introducing a lasting injury system in Dungeons and Dragons 5th edition can greatly enhance the depth and realism of your adventures. Combat, a cornerstone of the game, gains significant weight as each encounter carries potential long-term consequences. This system not only makes every decision in battle consequential but also turns health into a crucial resource that demands thoughtful management, adding a layer of strategic complexity.

The lasting injury mechanic fosters a sense of camaraderie among players as they must now invest in each other's well-being, reinforcing the bonds of their adventuring party. By raising the stakes in this way, victories become even more rewarding, and surviving against the odds offers an unparalleled sense of accomplishment. In essence, this system deepens player engagement, making every encounter, decision, and dice roll truly matter in their shared story.

Below is a revised version of the [original Injury Rules]({% link _posts/2022-10-01-injured-condition-onednd.md %}) I created based on the OneDnD playtest changes to Exhaustion.

### Injured [Condition]

While you are subject to the Injured Condition, you experience the following effects:

- **Levels of Injury.** This Condition is cumulative. Each time you receive it, you gain 1 level of injury. You die if your injury level exceeds 10.

- **d20 Rolls Affected.** When you make a d20 Test, you subtract your injury level from your d20 roll.

- **Spell Save DCs Affected.** Subtract your injury level from the Spell save DC of any Spell you cast.

- **Gaining the Condition.** A character gains 1 level of Injury whenever they fail a death save or if they are damaged by more than half their max hit points from a single source of damage. Characters killed through the Massive Damage rules gain 10 levels of Injury.

- **Recovering.** Immediately after finishing a Long Rest, the character may make a DC 10 Constitution Test, removing 1 level of injury on a success. Characters who fail by rolling a 1 gain an additional injury level. A character may gain advantage on a recovery roll if they are being provided medical care, provided hot meals, and in a restful environment, or other conditions as determined by the DM. Characters without adequate shelter or in a very stressful environment roll recovery at disadvantage. When their injury level reaches 0, the character is no longer injured.

#### Class Ability 

**Shake it Off.** Fighters, Paladins, and Rangers gain the 'Shake it off' ability at 1st level. As a free action, the character can choose to tap their deep reserves of fortitude to prevent taking one level of Injury. They can use this ability once and regain the ability to do so after a Long Rest.

#### Magic

- **Healing Injury with Magic.** One level of Injury may be removed by casting Lesser Restoration. Greater Restoration removes all levels of injury.

- **Bring Out Your Dead.** Any injury remains with a character brought back to life through Revivify, or Raise Dead, with a maximum of Injury level 9. Resurrection, True Resurrection, and Wish bring characters back to life with 0 levels of injury.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, incorporating the Injury rules in a Dungeons and Dragons game adds a whole new layer of strategic depth and emotional engagement. It elevates the stakes of every combat encounter, pushing players to think more critically about their actions and encouraging a greater sense of camaraderie within the party. This not only enhances the realism of the game but also enriches the storytelling, creating a more immersive and memorable experience. While it's a more challenging way to play, the rewards are substantial, making each victory a testament to the players' resilience and teamwork.

title: Introduction to the World of Etherea

    - Lore

description: An introduction my homebrew setting of Etherea, for use with the Shadowdark RPG.
---

Etherea is the initial idea for a setting I've crafted for the [Shadowdark](https://www.thearcanelibrary.com/pages/shadowdark){:target="_blank"} Tabletop Roleplaying game, designed to foster a sense of intrigue and danger inherent in the exploration of magic and the supernatural. The core concept of the world, the Umbraweave, is meant to evoke a persistent sense of mystery and unease, underlining the idea that behind the veil of reality, potent emotions and intense events birth spirits that drift in the shadows. The aim is to instill a constant sense of tension and wonder in the players, offering them a world where magic is as unpredictable and dangerous as it is powerful.

These initial freeform thoughts on Etherea's history, the rationale behind its magic, and the intricate weave of its religious beliefs are intended to set the stage for an array of adventurous narratives. The remnants of once great empires and fallen civilizations provide a treasure trove of mysteries to unearth, ancient secrets to decipher, and lost treasures to claim. The omnipresent threat of the Umbraweave and its Echoforms, alongside the complex interplay between Weavers and the pious, further drive the sense of imminent danger and conflict. Overall, Etherea is a world shaped by its past, teeming with potential for daring exploits, and ripe for heroes to make their mark.

I plan to continue to chip away at this setting as I gear up to run some Shadowdark in the near future.

### Etherea: A Shattered Elegy

{% include imageframe.html
  figure_class="float-end ms-4 clearfix"
  src="/assets/img/etherea-setting-lineart.jpg"
  alt="A massive ruined city overgrown in forest dwarfing a band of adventurers."
  width="480" height="480"
 %}

Etherea is a shattered world that was once teeming with magic and wonder. Its landscape was adorned with grand citadels, crystal forests, and cities of floating spires that touched the stars. Etherea was home to mighty empires and enlightened civilizations whose command of magic was unrivaled. They had learned to dance with the Umbraweave, the mysterious realm of spirits, making it their partner in the grand performance of existence.

In the age known as the Aetherium, the Weavers of Legend, Etherea's most powerful mages, sought to harness the Umbraweave's power in unprecedented ways. In their ambition, they dared to pull the Umbraweave closer to Etherea, believing they could tame the wild energies of the spectral realm and bend them to their will.

However, their hubris proved to be their downfall. This cataclysmic event, now known as the Echofall, triggered an uncontrolled flood of magic and spirits into Etherea. The once distant whisper of the Umbraweave became a deafening roar. Echoforms, both benevolent and malevolent, poured into the world, their unchecked power reshaping reality and wreaking havoc on the once-great civilizations.

Kingdoms fell overnight, their grand cities crumbling under the onslaught of wild magic. Forests grew and withered in the span of moments, and rivers flowed backwards, their waters turning into shimmering liquid light. Beings of pure emotion roamed the land, their mere presence inciting joy, despair, rage, and a thousand other emotions in those they encountered. The world was thrown into chaos, and the great cultures of Etherea were reduced to ruins and distant memories.

For centuries, Etherea was a fractured realm, a shadow of its former glory. Yet, life is resilient, and the spark of civilization is not easily extinguished. Humanity, along with the other races of Etherea, slowly began to adapt to this new reality, learning to live among the Echoforms and the unpredictable forces of magic. New settlements began to sprout amidst the ruins of the old, like flowers blooming amidst the rubble.

Now, hundreds of years after the Echofall, civilization is once again taking root in Etherea. The world is still wild and dangerous, but the people of Etherea have learned much from their tragic past. The Weavers have rekindled their ancient traditions, guiding their people in the delicate dance with the Umbraweave.

The echoes of the past still resonate in the Umbraweave, but Etherea stands poised at the dawn of a new age. It is a time of hope and fear, a time of magic and monsters, a time of heroes and legends yet to be born. The story of Etherea continues, written by those brave enough to shape their destiny in a world where thoughts and emotions can reshape reality.

## The Lore of the Shadow Spirits

In the realm of Etherea, a world teetering on the precipice of light and darkness, the thoughts, emotions, and actions of every living being are far more potent than they appear. Unseen by mortal eyes, a shadowy realm lies adjacent to our own, a spectral echo of Etherea known as the Umbraweave. Here, spirits manifest and drift, formed and fueled by the potent emotions and events that transpire in the world of the living.

The Umbraweave is not just a reflection but an amplifier of our world. An argument between lovers might birth a minor spirit of discord, while a great battle may give rise to a terrifying spirit of destruction. These spirits, known as Echoforms, exist in a vast array, each embodying a different facet of mortal experience. From fleeting spirits of joy, born from laughter and merriment, to lingering spirits of sorrow, born from loss and grief, each Echoform is a testament to the emotional tapestry of Etherea.

The people of Etherea have developed intricate beliefs and rituals over centuries to contend with the influence of the Umbraweave. The threat of inadvertently creating or attracting malevolent Echoforms has shaped a society that values emotional balance and mindful action. Celebrations are tempered with moments of quiet reflection, and even in war, soldiers take moments to calm their anger and focus their intent, lest they birth spirits of uncontrolled wrath.

Warding off these spirits has become an essential part of life. People carry talismans imbued with positive emotions to shield against spirits of anger or sorrow. Homes are often adorned with intricate glyphs, prayers, and blessings to keep the dwelling safe from Echoforms. Mirrors, believed to be gateways to the Umbraweave, are covered at night to prevent spirits from crossing over into the physical world.

Despite the fear of the Umbraweave, not all spirits are seen as harmful. Some Echoforms are considered beneficial, such as spirits of inspiration born from creativity, or spirits of love born from deep affection. These spirits are often invited into homes and gatherings with specific rituals, offerings, and music.

It is the task of the Spiritseers, individuals gifted with the ability to perceive the Umbraweave and communicate with Echoforms, to navigate the delicate balance of this world. They work to placate harmful spirits, invite beneficial ones, and guide society in their complex dance with the Echoforms.

The Umbraweave's existence has shaped the world of Etherea in profound ways. It is a testament to the power of emotion, a stark reminder of the consequences of actions, and a hauntingly beautiful mirror to the world of the living. In Etherea, one's inner state is not just a personal affair; it can shape the world and echo through the shadowy reaches of the Umbraweave.

### Arcana of the Umbraweave

{% include imageframe.html
  figure_class="float-end ms-4 clearfix"
  src="/assets/img/etherea-magic-lineart.jpg"
  alt="A man standing in the middle of a magical strom of lightning, his face twisting."
  width="480" height="480"
 %}


Magic in Etherea is not merely a tool, but a profound expression of the inner self interacting with the vast, unseen forces of the Umbraweave. It is an art of intention and emotion, a delicate dance with the Echoforms, and a testament to the willpower of those who dare to shape reality through the shadow realm.

The practitioners of this art are known as Weavers. By fostering intense emotions, vivid thoughts, and unwavering intent within themselves, Weavers can resonate with the forces of the Umbraweave and give form to magic. These spells can range from minor enchantments, like kindling a spark of flame or whispering to the wind, to cataclysmic events, such as commanding a storm or shaking the very earth.

Weaving is a delicate process, requiring not just raw emotion but also precise control. A Weaver must learn to balance the intensity of their feelings with the clarity of their intentions. Too much emotion without control can result in a Wild Surge, an unpredictable burst of magic that resonates with the caster's uncontrolled feelings. This often results in a rogue Echoform being birthed into the world, a force with desires and goals of its own, unbound and potentially harmful to the Weaver and those around them.

A Weaver's path is one of constant self-discovery and discipline. They must learn to explore their inner emotional landscapes, confront their fears, and channel their passions. They must also learn to understand the Echoforms, for each spell is a conversation, a negotiation with the spirits of the Umbraweave.

There are many ways to become a Weaver. Some are born with an innate connection to the Umbraweave, while others study under experienced mentors. Some find their calling through near-death experiences, profound emotional events, or deep spiritual revelations.

The Echo Codex, a sacred text among Weavers, details the known Echoforms and the emotions that give them form. It also outlines the techniques to master one's emotional state and provides guidance on negotiating with Echoforms. The Codex is not just a book but a living record, continually updated with the discoveries and experiences of Weavers across Etherea.

In Etherea, magic is not just an exercise of power; it's a testament to one's inner strength, a reflection of their deepest emotions, and a constant reminder of the delicate balance between control and chaos.

### Divinity and Faith in Etherea

In the world of Etherea, the divine is not a distant concept but an integral part of life, woven into the fabric of existence itself. Above the Echo-laden Umbraweave, in realms of spiritual vision and celestial majesty, dwell the gods of Etherea.

Each god embodies a grand ideal, a celestial echo of the aspirations, hopes, and fears of the mortal world. They range from Luminara, the goddess of Light and Hope, to Obsidia, the god of Shadows and Secrets. Their influences are as varied as the ideals they embody, their will projected into the world through the spiritual conduit of the Umbraweave.

The people of Etherea honor these gods in their daily lives. Grand temples and humble shrines dot the landscapes, each a testament to the devotion of the faithful. Most Ethereans practice a form of polytheism, offering prayers and sacrifices to multiple gods depending on their needs, desires, or fears. However, some individuals feel a deep connection to a single god and dedicate their lives to that deity's service. This devotion might stem from a desire for protection, a quest for personal power, or a profound spiritual calling.

This deep faith has led to a tension between the devout and the Weavers. Many of the pious see Weavers as attempting to usurp the divine, their manipulation of the Umbraweave seen as an audacious challenge to the gods themselves. This tension sometimes leads to conflict, with Weavers facing persecution or mistrust in more devout communities.

Yet the divine landscape of Etherea is not limited to these grand ideals. Just as the world is filled with Echoforms, so too is it filled with smaller gods, local deities born from intense Echoforms fostered by specific traditions, rites, or even locations. These deities might rule over a single river, a particular forest, or even a humble village. They are deeply tied to the communities that worship them, their fates and fortunes often seen as intertwined.

Such is the grand tapestry of faith in Etherea. It is a world where the divine is as varied and complex as the people who worship them, where the line between mortal and god can blur, and where the echoes of belief shape not just the Umbraweave, but the very fate of the world itself.

title: Design Goals of Etherea

description: An introduction my homebrew setting of Etherea, for use with the Shadowdark RPG.
---

Yesterday, I posted some initial lore for [Etherea]({% link _posts/2023-05-13-the-world-of-etherea.md %}) (Ah-Ther-ee-ah), a homebrew world am interested in developing for a setting I'm creating for a new [Shadowdark](https://www.thearcanelibrary.com/pages/shadowdark){:target="_blank"} game. This is a personal endeavor, not intended for publication (other than on my blog here). I'm captivated by the idea of things manifesting in the world based on emotions, beliefs, etc., and the resulting chaos of magic surrounding it. The concept is akin to the Umbra from Werewolf: The Forsaken, Spren in the Stormlight Archives, or entities like the creature in the Babadook that manifests from fear or unfulfilled wishes.

An essential aspect of Etherea is its vibrant diversity. The gods are not a static, singular pantheon, but a fluid and dynamic reflection of the world's diverse cultures, beliefs, and aspirations. The world doesn't merely exist; it actively shapes itself in response to the collective imaginations, desires, and fears of its inhabitants. This mutable nature is a double-edged sword. It's both the root of Etherea's challenges and the source of its profound beauty and richness.

As a game setting, I'm interested in creating lore elements that:

{% include imageframe.html
  figure_class="float-end ms-4 clearfix"
  src="/assets/img/design-of-etherea.jpg"
  alt="A man sitting at a desk writing while surrounded by fantasy imagines from their imagination."
  width="480" height="480"
 %}

1. **Provide rich backstories and conflicts for characters:** The history and cultures of Etherea, the tensions between Weavers and the devout, and the looming threats of the Umbraweave all provide interesting hooks for character backstories and personal quests.
2. **Facilitate immersive world-building:** The interplay between Etherea and the Umbraweave, the mystery of fallen civilizations, and the omnipresent influence of the gods create a rich tapestry for players to explore and interact with.
3. **Drive interesting adventures and quests:** The dangers lurking in the shadows of the Umbraweave, the treasures hidden in the ruins of once-great empires, and the complex religious and magical dynamics of Etherea provide a myriad of opportunities for thrilling adventures.
4. **Encourage exploration of thematic elements:** The nuances of harnessing emotions to shape magic, the ethical implications of manipulating the Umbraweave, and the balance between faith and personal power all offer players the chance to delve into deeper thematic discussions.
5. **Promote varied gameplay styles:** The setting supports a wide range of gameplay styles, from combat-focused adventures battling Echoforms, to diplomatic missions negotiating religious tensions, to exploration and puzzle-solving in the remnants of fallen civilizations.
6. **Foster dynamic NPC interactions:** The diverse cultures, religious beliefs, and attitudes towards magic in Etherea provide a rich cast of potential NPCs for players to interact with, each with their own unique perspectives and motivations.

As a tool for driving adventures, I want Etherea to offer a wealth of in-game elements, directly woven into its lore. This should provide a cohesive narrative framework for diverse adventures:

 {% include imageframe.html
  figure_class="float-end ms-4 clearfix"
  src="/assets/img/etherea-crystal-rain-ruin.jpg"
  alt="A massive ruin in an overgrown forest glows from the inside while crystal rain falls from the sky."
  width="480" height="480"
 %}

1. **Monster Encounters with Deep Lore:** Monsters in Etherea aren't just random encounters. Each creature is a manifestation of the region's history, emotions, and events, channeled through the Umbraweave. An abandoned ruin that fell victim to a cataclysmic event isn't simply vacant; it teems with vile creatures such as goblins, ghasts, and gibbering mouthers, all born from the tragedy's echo within the Umbraweave.

2. **Enhanced Magic System:** The Umbraweave's influence over magic allows for an amplification of the spell failure system already present in Shadowdark. Misshapen spells can take on a life of their own, turning against their caster, and creating both challenging and thrilling magic usage scenarios.

3. **Adventure Hooks Rooted in World-Building:** The world encourages various adventuring themes. Echohunters serve as a *Witcher-esque* professional class, hunting down dangerous Umbraweave manifestations. Delvers seek the mysteries and riches hidden within the ruins of the old world. Additionally, as Etherea rebuilds itself, emerging powers vie for dominance, creating a rich tapestry of political intrigue. The setting intentionally distances itself from the static "*Disneyland adventure*" style, focusing instead on a dynamic, ever-evolving world.

The core lore of Etherea—its cataclysmic history, the mystical Umbraweave, and complex religious dynamics—lays the groundwork for expanding on these elements. This initial exploration is primarily focused on establishing the foundation for the setting. In the coming weeks, I aim to delve deeper into the practical applications of these elements within the game. I'll further explore how they can be leveraged to craft engaging and immersive adventures in the world of Etherea.

Following this, I'll take a stab at creating a few actual towns. I plan to use spiral world development for this task, building out from some core settlements.

Recently, [DMDavid](https://twitter.com/dmdavidblog/status/1658104726297165830){:target="_blank"} posed a fascinating question on Twitter about the origins of the [Astral and Ethereal Planes](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/appendix-d-the-planes-of-existence#TransitivePlanes){:target="_blank"} in the early editions of Dungeons and Dragons (DnD). As a devoted Tabletop Roleplaying Game enthusiast, I'd like to delve into this intriguing query and shed some light on the cultural and historical influences that shaped these iconic facets of the game.

As an side, if you haven't had a chance to check out [DMDavid's Blog](https://dmdavid.com/){:target="_blank"}, I highly recommend it.

**Understanding the Historical Context**
To truly appreciate the distinction between the Astral and Ethereal planes in DnD, we need to consider the historical context. The inception of DnD occurred during a transformative period in the United States, post the counter-culture revolution, which significantly influenced the game’s development.

This counter-culture era witnessed a surge in a form of pseudo-spiritualism, centered around mind enlightenment and contacting higher planes, starkly contrasting previous generations' spiritual practices, which were more focused on spirit communication and ancient powers.

**The Ethereal and Astral Planes: Inspired by Cultural Icons**
In the minds of the DnD creators, the Ethereal plane became a domain of ghosts and the dead, drawing inspiration from pop culture figures like Aleister Crowley and skeptics like Harry Houdini. Conversely, the Astral Plane symbolized the realm of the mind, influenced by counter-culture figures like Aldous Huxley and Timothy Leary, or popular culture authors like Carlos Castaneda.

As DMDavid rightly noted, the depiction of these planes in DnD also heavily reflects the nerd pop-culture of that time, including elements from comic book characters like Doctor Strange or from movies like the Hammer Horror Films. However, rather than tracing back to a single source, it's more accurate to understand these planes as a reflection of the era's prevailing thoughts and influences.

**The Game Design Perspective**
From a game design viewpoint, the Ethereal and Astral planes provided a neat division between the realm of ghosts and the realm of psionics. This division addressed two main issues. First, it offered thematic consistency, neatly categorizing monsters and adventure themes. Second, it helped differentiate the rules for magic and ghosts from those for psionics, which were distinct in early D&D.

Interestingly, the original Dungeon Master's Guide had a staggering 24 planes, slicing not just along alignment lines but also across various narrative tones, such as emotion, thought, spirituality, and more.

**The Modern Perspective**
Fast forward to modern D&D, the distinction between the Astral and Ethereal planes seems to have lost much of its significance. The 5th edition (5e) appears to lean towards streamlining gameplay, favoring reduced complexity over the detailed cosmological intricacies of early D&D. For instance, Asmodeus has been elevated as the face of all devils, and the Nine Hells is now the most often cited plane.

While 5e continues to reference other planes, its focus is more on simplifying references for seamless play. This approach contrasts with the early days of D&D, where the cosmology's complexity was part of the allure, sparking a sense of the unknown in its audience.

In the end, each player must decide whether this shift towards simplification is beneficial. Regardless of the answer, the origins and historical context of the Astral and Ethereal planes in DnD provide a fascinating glimpse into the game's rich and diverse influences, adding another layer of depth to this already immersive game.

title: Experience Matters - The benefits of XP in 5th edition

description: Advocating for XP in D&D 5e. this post discusses its role in boosting engagement, diversifying actions, and improving game immersion.
---

In the diverse world of Tabletop Role-Playing Games (TTRPGs), the progression system you choose can significantly influence the way your campaign unfolds. In 5th edition Dungeons & Dragons (D&D), two popular methods of character progression exist: Experience Points (XP) and Milestone Advancement. While Milestone Advancement has its merits, I am here to make a case for XP, an often overlooked, but immensely beneficial system.

In a previous post I discussed the [Zen of Awarding Experience for Roleplaying]({% link _posts/2021-02-25-the-zen-of-awarding-experience-for-roleplaying.md %}) which demonstrates an easy method for awarding non-combat experience.  DMs can apply this to exploration or any activity beyond killing creatures. Chapters 8 and 3 of the 5e DMG also provide some guidance on this as well.  I had a recent exchange online that helped me summarize what I see the forgotten benefits of using XP are.  I thought I'd share them here.

  figure_class="float-end ms-4 clearfix"
  src="/assets/img/PlayerWithDiceAndPaper.jpg"
  alt="A player rolling dice and looking over their character sheets."
  width="480" height="480"
 %}

**Building a World One XP at a Time**   
XP connects characters to their actions within the world. Each monster slain, each trap disarmed, every cleverly negotiated encounter, earns the characters XP, helping them grow stronger and more skilled. This system offers a tangible reward for engaging with the world, breathing life into the setting and making it matter to the players.

Milestone advancement, on the other hand, rewards characters simply for reaching certain points in the narrative. While this can create a clear path of progression, it misses a fundamental aspect of immersive role-play: the player's interaction with the world. Milestone Advancement risks reducing the world to a mere backdrop against which the narrative unfolds, rather than an integral part of the story.

**Pacing and Enjoying the Adventure with XP**     
An often overlooked benefit of using XP is its influence on the game's pacing. By linking character progression to actions within the game, XP allows the pace to ebb and flow naturally. It's not a rigid timer, but a flexible measure of progress that reflects the story's rhythm and the players' actions. This fluidity also encourages players to immerse themselves in the unfolding events rather than racing to level up every few sessions.

Moreover, the XP system allows players to savor the charm of lower level play. Personally, I find D&D 5e most enjoyable at levels 7 or below, with a sweet spot between levels 3 to 5. Using XP slows down the game just enough to let players fully experience the content. It provides players, particularly newcomers, with ample time to familiarize themselves with their class abilities, deepening their connection to the game and enhancing their overall experience.

**A Diversity of Incentives**     
XP offers a flexible incentive system that can be tailored to the style of your campaign. Too often, DMs limit XP rewards to combat encounters. However, XP can be a motivating factor for a variety of actions. Award XP for clever problem-solving, negotiating with NPCs, or even for great role-playing moments. This diversity of incentives can drive engagement, encouraging players to think creatively and interact with the world in unique ways.

**A Log of Memories**    
Tracking XP can also provide an unexpected benefit: a log of your campaign's major events. By noting down the sources of XP, you create a record of the group's achievements and memorable moments. This can add depth to your campaign, fostering a sense of nostalgia and achievement as players look back on their journey.

**Addressing D&D's Reward Structure**   
However, it's also crucial to critique the overall reward structure in D&D 5e. Wizards of the Coast, in their bid to make the game more appealing, have filled character classes with numerous abilities. While this empowers players and adds complexity, it also creates a potential issue.

The plethora of class features reduces the need for external rewards such as magical items or gold, thus diminishing the need for characters to interact with the world. This can lead to characters feeling disconnected from the setting or campaign.

Using XP is a small tool to combat this issue. By tying character progression to specific actions and outcomes, XP can reestablish a tangible connection between the characters and the world. It reintroduces the necessity of exploring, negotiating, and engaging with the campaign setting, fostering a more immersive role-playing experience.

**A Word of Caution**   
While XP offers numerous benefits, it's essential to be mindful of what you award XP for. Avoid giving XP for actions that undermine the spirit of the game, such as unnecessary aggression or disruptive behavior. XP is a tool to guide your players, encouraging them to engage in ways that enrich the campaign. Also, don't fall into the trap of awarding XP to correct **bad** behavior at the table.  Many DMs who use XP look at negative player behavior and think and easy solution is to award experience for things like collaborating or showing up on time.  This seems attractive, but using in game incentives to address out of game issues will always come back to bite you. If there is behavior that needs to be address, do that, but don't fall into the trap of thinking in game rules will correct bad player behavior.


**Conclusion**    
In conclusion, XP is more than just a mechanic for character progression. It's a tool that, when used correctly, can foster engagement, enhance immersion, and create a richer, more rewarding D&D experience. In 5th edition, our tools for connecting players to the world are few. Finding fun ways to do that can help build a more holistic narrative and immersive experience for all.  What do you think though?  How has experience worked for you in the past? Would you be tempted to give XP a try after reading this or are you ride-or-die on Milestone?  Drop me a comment [over on twitter](https://twitter.com/optionalrule){:target="_blank"} to let me know what you think.

description: Lore for the City of Vathirond in the Eberron setting.
---


<div class="text-bg-light mb-3 p-3 lead">As a Dungeon Master, there's nothing quite as enticing as the prospect of molding a lesser-known city into a stage for unforgettable adventures. In 2019, I found myself drawn to the city of Vathirond, tucked away in far eastern Breeland, on the fringes of Eberron's haunting Mournlands. With the Brey River's southern bank underfoot and the specter of the Gray Mist as a backdrop, Vathirond was an irresistible canvas for my homebrew campaign. Yet, as fate would have it, our journey through this enigmatic city was cut short due to the COVID pandemic. Now, after a couple of years, I've dusted off my notes and decided to share them with the world. Whether you're a seasoned Dungeon Master or a curious reader, I hope you find these glimpses into Vathirond - the city on the edge of the Mournlands - as fascinating as I did while crafting them.
</div>

Situated amidst the low, rolling hills of the northern Dunvar Valley, the city of Vathirond was once a vibrant hub of creativity and artistry, where inspiration flowed as freely as the wind. The city, renowned across Khorvaire for its extravagant displays of artistic prowess, was known to entice artists and creators from all corners of the continent. They were drawn not only by the vibrancy of Vathirond's culture but also by the city's minor manifest zone to Xoriat, the plane of madness, which imbued the city with an aura of wild inspiration.

  caption="The Crown of Masks"
 %}

However, the Last War has left the city a shadow of its former self, its once-gleaming Crowns now scarred by conflict and its streets haunted by memories of a brighter past. The Mournlands loom ominously on the eastern horizon, a stark, ever-present reminder of the devastation wrought by the Last War. From the city's highest points, one can see the unnatural, eerie glow that seems to perpetually hang over the scarred landscape. This spectral vista casts a pall over Vathirond, a constant reminder of a cataclysm yet to be fully understood. The very sight of it evokes a mix of dread, sorrow, and grim fascination among the city's inhabitants. Its unnerving presence fuels a sense of urgency among the residents of Vathirond, a constant reminder of the fragility of peace and the cost of conflict. Yet, in a testament to the indomitable spirit of the city's people, the looming specter of the Mournlands also inspires a defiant determination. They see the Mournlands not just as a symbol of past horrors, but also as a challenge to be overcome, a puzzle to be solved, and a destiny they must prevent for their own city.

## The Shattered Crowns

Nestled within the city of Vathirond, six semi-autonomous districts – known as the Crowns – stand prominently, each perched atop its own hill and fortified by formidable walls. This unique arrangement provided strategic defense throughout the ravages of The Last War, each Crown bearing the brunt of the conflict and experiencing a different outcome. Each Crown was originally dedicated to a particular artistic discipline, fostering a unique culture and identity that has persisted amidst turmoil. These districts are more than just geographic divisions; they represent the diverse tapestry of Vathirond's spirit, embodying the resilience, creativity, and individuality of the city's past and present. The Crowns serve as unique reminders of the city's artistic heritage, even as they evolve in response to the aftermath of war.

### Crown of Masks: Applause and Back Stage Deals

 The stage for stories, the canvas for compelling characters, and the sounding board for stirring soliloquies – the Crown of Masks has been the heart of theater and drama in Vathirond. Despite the ruinous touch of the war, it has retained a faded grandeur. Its buildings are reminiscent of an era of creativity and artistry, their embellished facades narrating tales of yesteryears. This Crown was fortunate to have survived the worst of the Last War, maintaining a semblance of its former glory.

The ward now serves as the militaristic nucleus of Vathirond's fragmented government. It's a command hub for military logistics, but also a political stage that hosts heated debates on the city's future. It is from here that the populist Narani Laseur has polarized the city's sentiment over refugee resettlement and rebuilding rights.

Laseur's controversial administration is backed by a private security force, the Firehawk Legion. These goblinoid mercenaries from Darguun are a jarring sight against the backdrop of dramatic mosaics and grand theater facades. However, their presence is a stark reminder of the city's current reality - a stage where the drama of survival unfolds daily.

The Crown of Masks, once a hub of artistic endeavor, now mirrors the city's resilience amidst adversity. It's a poignant testament to the spirit of Vathirond - a city holding onto its identity, its memory of past glory, even as it faces an uncertain future.

### Crown of Satyrs: Twists, Turns, and Triumph

Among the dance of shadows and the glow of the lantern light, the Crown of Satyrs spins a tale of grace in the face of ruin. The streets here twist and turn like a dancer mid-routine, unraveling onto expansive squares that once pulsated with the rhythm of impromptu performances. This Crown's spirit proved as nimble as its inhabitants, retaining a significant portion of its population through the throes of The Last War. Community bonds, stronger than the aged stones of their homes, anchor the people in a warm embrace of shared experience and stubborn resilience. 

Here, House Phiarlan stands as an enduring symbol of the district's tenacity, operating from a smaller yet still magnificent corner of their once sprawling complex. Their performers, the city's mesmerizing heartbeats, still captivate with their tales of sorrow and survival. This Crown, however, does more than dance. It watches. From the city's underbelly to the swelling tide of refugees, from the ghostly echoes of The Mournlands to the subtle shifts in power within Vathirond, nothing escapes the watchful eyes of the Satyrs.

### Crown of Sirens: Echoes of a Melodious Past

The Crown of Sirens, once the jewel of Vathirond's vibrant music scene, now wears a cloak of desolation. The last notes of harmony faded away during the tumult of the Last War, replaced by the dissonant chords of silence and decay.

In its prime, the Crown of Sirens echoed with melodies that transcended language and culture. It was home to the Lonteu Opera House, a grand stage where performers from across Khorvaire gathered to serenade audiences with their songs. Music was the lifeblood of the ward; it flowed from its concert halls, meandered through its streets, and suffused the air with a symphony of shared emotions - joy, sorrow, love, and longing.  Heavily damaged during the ware, the Opera House is not the headquarters for the Korranberg Institute for Mournlands Research (KIMR).

However, the crescendo of the Last War proved too overwhelming. The Crown's defenses were breached, and the once-thriving ward bore the brunt of relentless assaults. Its grand architecture was marred by the scars of war, its harmonious rhythm disrupted by the cacophony of destruction.

Today, the Crown of Sirens stands as a testament to the impermanence of glory and the inevitable cycle of creation and ruin. The ward, though a shadow of its former self, has not been completely abandoned. The ruins of once great townhouses serve as a shelter for those displaced by the war. Migrants from Cyre, the Dunvar Valley, and veterans who could not leave the battlefield behind have found solace within its broken walls. Their stories of loss and longing lend a new, melancholic melody to the ward, as poignant as the songs once sung on the opera stage.

House Tharashk, utilizing their unique dragonmarked talents for finding people and things, offer their services to refugees and travelers desperately searching for lost loved ones or belongings in the blighted expanses of the Dunvar Valley and the enigmatic Mournlands. The enclave, while a stark reminder of the tragedies of the past, embodies a spirit of resilience and the enduring hope of reconnection.

  caption="The Crown of Crafts"
 %}

### Crown of Crafts: From Artistry to Industry

Once a flourishing hub of creative expression, the Crown of Crafts served as the canvas for Vathirond's sculptors and painters. Its streets were lined with grand architecture, adorned with vibrant murals and intricate statues that reflected the heart and soul of its citizens. Now, this Crown bears the telltale signs of war's toll and the relentless march of industry.

The Crown of Crafts, in its heyday, was a living testament to the artistic spirit of Vathirond. Every street corner boasted an artisan's shop, and the air was suffused with the scent of fresh paint, chiseled stone, and the underlying sense of creation. The once-colorful facades were a riot of artistic expression, every mural telling a story, each statue capturing a moment frozen in time.

However, the Last War brought change - the vibrant strokes of paint and chisel strokes gave way to the clang of metal and the grind of machinery. The Crown, once a sanctuary for artists, was transformed into a massive forge to fuel the war effort and, in its aftermath, the city's reconstruction.

The Crown of Crafts, once under House Cannith's influential sway, found new leadership in independent crafters and salvage gangs following the house's abandonment during the final years of the Last War. House Cannith's attempts to return and reassert its authority meets strong resistance, as these crafters and gangs who filled the void fiercely defend their hard-earned independence. This struggle has created a cauldron of tension, as the Crown teeters between acknowledging House Cannith's legacy and embracing their newfound autonomy.

### Crown of Sphinxes: Watchful Sentries and Hidden Enigmas

The Crown of Sphinxes was once a lyrical sanctuary, home to riddlers and poets who spun mysteries into verse and shrouded wisdom in enigma. Its labyrinthine streets held a mystique that whispered of cryptic puzzles and enticing riddles. However, the grandeur of this district was not immune to the ravages of the Last War. In the strategic turmoil, the Moonfox Brigade, soldiers from House Deneith under the command of the Brelish King, claimed this Crown as their military base.

This militarization has stripped the Crown of Sphinxes of some of its old-world charm. The dazzling and enigmatic architecture has been refitted to serve practical, utilitarian purposes, yet echoes of its former glory persist. Faded etchings, inscriptions of old poems, riddles, and sage wisdom, still adorn the worn stone, serving as a poignant reminder of the Crown's vibrant past.

Access to the Crown of Sphinxes is strictly regulated. Its streets are patrolled day and night by the ever-watchful eyes of the Moonfox Brigade, maintaining a tight rein on security and order. In this austere environment, House Kundarak maintains its presence, a stalwart amidst the change.

While the Crown of Sphinxes has lost some of its whimsical charm, it stands today as a symbol of resilience and adaptation, a testament to Vathirond's spirit in the face of adversity. Its layered history has left a rich tapestry of tales, a myriad of riddles yet to be solved.

### The Crown of Jests: Echos of Laugher & Whispers of Pain

The Crown of Jests once rang with peals of laughter and the clamor of revelry, its streets a lively theater of camaraderie and mirth. Where bars, taverns, and burlesque shows were once the heart of Vathirond's nightlife, an air of strained cheerfulness now prevails. Laughter and music still flow from its many establishments, but they serve more as a balm for the weary souls seeking an escape from the city's woes than genuine festivity.

Despite the trials of war and its aftermath, the Crown of Jests sees the most traffic among all the Crowns. It offers a welcome respite for residents and visitors alike, a haven where they can briefly forget their troubles amidst the lively taverns, grand townhouses, and street performances.

In this bustling district, House Ghallanda stands as a beacon of hospitality and resilience. Its enclave thrives amidst the revelry and recovery, the house members taking pride in their steadfast support of Vathirond throughout the hardships. The members of House Ghallanda are considered the unofficial caretakers of the Crown of Jests, their establishments serving as a haven for the city's weary.

House Orien, on the other hand, holds a dwindling presence around the lightning rail line. Once a thriving nexus connecting the far reaches of Khorvaire, the rail line now ends abruptly at the outskirts of Vathirond, cut off by the hauntingly mysterious wall of mist that is the Mournland. Yet even in its decline, the outpost stands as a testament to a more connected era, a time before war and calamity shattered the unity of the continent. 

While the Crown of Jests may have lost some of its former vibrancy, its spirit remains undeterred. It serves as a testament to Vathirond's enduring will to find joy amidst sorrow, to laugh in the face of despair, and to retain a spark of hope amidst the ruins.

### The Gutters: Resilience Amid Ruin

Nestled between the walls of Vathirond's Crowns, away from the majestic hilltops, lie "The Gutters." This labyrinth of alleyways and improvised dwellings sprawls across the lower depressions of the city, a stark contrast to the high walls and grand structures above.

The Gutters were once home to the laborers and workers whose toil and sweat fueled the life and vibrancy of the Crowns. These hard-working individuals lived and thrived in the shadow of the hilltops, unshielded by the protective walls that enveloped the Crowns. During the Last War, this vulnerability was exploited, and the Gutters bore the brunt of destruction, time and time again. Buildings were razed, families were uprooted, and the streets echoed with the toll of loss.

In the war's aftermath, however, The Gutters did not stay silent for long. The area quickly became a refuge for the displaced, the downtrodden, and those holding onto the memories of homes lost to the war. Its winding streets and damaged buildings filled up with makeshift homes, erected by refugees and the city's poorest citizens. Each structure, no matter how frail or makeshift, stands as a monument to human resilience.

Many of the refugees from Cyre found a haven in The Gutters following The Mourning. Struggling with the memory of their fallen kingdom and unable to move on, they have built a life among the ruins, infusing the area with the spirit of their lost homeland. Despite the hardship, or perhaps because of it, a strong sense of community binds the residents of The Gutters. This unity, borne out of shared suffering and hope, has turned The Gutters into a beating heart of survival within Vathirond.

Now, The Gutters are a testament to the human will to endure. Amidst the battered and patched structures, in the narrow alleyways teeming with life, you find stories of courage, resilience, and the undying hope for a better tomorrow. Even in the bleakest of places, the spirit of Vathirond — indomitable and ever enduring — continues to shine.

## Dunvar Valley: From Fertile Lands to Haunted Battlegrounds

The Dunvar Valley, extending hundreds of miles southeast of Vathirond, is a poignant reminder of the cost of war. Once a lush, verdant gem, it was known for its fertile fields and abundant harvests. The valley was a symbol of prosperity, a testament to the bounty of Khorvaire's heartlands. But the Last War changed everything.

As one of the most hotly contested frontlines, the Dunvar Valley was transformed into a brutal battleground. The soil, once nurturing crops and life, was stained with the blood of soldiers, churned under the weight of war machines, and scarred by the devastating spells of battle mages. The once peaceful landscape was marred by trenches and fortifications, its tranquility shattered by the relentless drumbeat of conflict.

Today, the Dunvar Valley is a treacherous expanse, a haunting vista of war's devastating aftermath. The skeletal remains of arcane constructs, broken weapons, and discarded munitions litter the land like grim monuments to the lives lost and the peace that was shattered. This battlefield-turned-graveyard is eerily silent, the quiet only broken by the occasional whistle of the wind or the distant cry of a scavenging bird.

Despite its grim nature, the valley has become a source of livelihood for many of Vathirond's residents. Salvage crews, hardened by their grim work and driven by necessity, comb through the wreckage, risking their lives to recover anything of value. These individuals, often refugees or those unable to find other work, brave the hidden dangers of the valley - unstable magic, booby traps, rogue constructs, and more. Bitter rivalries between salvage crews often spilling over into violent confrontations, echo the conflicts of the past.

The Dunvar Valley serves as a harsh lesson and a bleak memorial to the Last War. Its shattered landscape is a testament to the destructive force of conflict, a warning of the price of ambition and aggression. Yet, amidst the ruins and desolation, the resilience of its people persists. Despite the hardships, they continue to find ways to survive and even hope for a brighter future. In this, the spirit of the Dunvar Valley, much like Vathirond itself, remains unbroken.

## Faith in Vathirond: A Beacon Amid Ruin

Religion and faith play a crucial role in the daily lives of Vathirond's citizens. The city, though shadowed by devastation and strife, remains a place of profound spiritual diversity and resilience. It is in their faith that many find the strength to face the trials of each day, the courage to endure, and the hope to rebuild.

Vathirond boasts numerous temples dedicated to the Sovereign Host, a testament to the enduring popularity of Khorvaire's principal religion. These grand structures, though weathered by war and time, continue to be places of comfort, guidance, and community. Worship of the Silver Flame, owing to Vathirond's proximity to Thrane, is also strongly represented. Despite the damage suffered during the Last War, the city's largest cathedral remains a shining beacon of faith and charity, a source of healing and solace for the weary and the wounded.

In the wake of the refugee influx following the Last War, the city's spiritual landscape has become even more diverse. Small shrines devoted to lesser deities have sprouted throughout Vathirond, each a testament to the steadfast faith of its followers. The blend of cultures and traditions brought by the refugees has added to the spiritual tapestry of the city, creating a mosaic of faiths living side by side.

Adding to the city's spiritual depth are the whispered legends of ancient Dhakaani runes and secret shrines to The Dark Six. These rumors speak of hidden places deep beneath the city, mystical relics from a bygone era. While few can confirm the truth of these tales, they continue to fuel the city's folklore, piquing the interest of adventurers and scholars alike. Some fear the influence of The Dark Six, while others are drawn to the promise of ancient knowledge and power.

Religion in Vathirond is not just a matter of personal belief, but a cornerstone of community identity and solidarity. Amid the ruins of their city, the people of Vathirond cling to their faith, drawing strength from their deities and from one another. Their unbroken spirit, reflected in their enduring religious practices, lights the way towards a hopeful future.

## The Shadow of House Phiarlan

House Phiarlan's schism, which gave rise to House Thuranni, was a wound inflicted on the very heart of Vathirond. With the house's close ties to the arts, Vathirond was a stronghold for Phiarlan, its vibrant culture a camouflage for the house's covert activities. The schism turned the city into a battlefield overnight, the conflict fought not on open fields but in shadowed corners and behind closed doors. 

This silent, deadly night is now referred to as the "Moonlight Murders" among Vathirond's citizens. It was a ballet of death as spies and assassins moved like wraiths through the city, leaving a trail of bodies in their wake. The next morning, Vathirond woke to an unspoken horror, death having visited its homes, taverns, brothels, and bathhouses alike.

Despite the horrific events of that night, many believe that not all of House Phiarlan's secrets were laid bare. Whispers of lost dragonmarked artifacts or vaults of stolen knowlege persist, hidden throughout the city, lying in wait to be discovered by the worthy or the fortunate. These artifacts are said to hold immense power, their recovery a matter of pride and prestige within House Phiarlan.

Today, Vathirond is considered a cursed city by House Phiarlan. The scars of the schism run deep, a constant reminder of the house's internal strife and the lives lost. Despite this, a small outpost remains in the city, its members performing their duties with a bittersweet mix of resolve and resignation. Sent there as a form of punishment, these Phiarlan members continue their work, providing much-needed cheer through their artistic endeavors and keeping an eye on the developments at the edge of the Mournland. The presence of House Phiarlan, albeit nominal, is a testament to Vathirond's importance and the house's resilience in the face of adversity.

## Factions in the Fray

In the wake of the Last War, new powers have risen within Vathirond:

**The Moonfox Brigade**, a formidable assembly of House Deneith mercenaries, operates as the bulwark between Vathirond and the ominous threats emanating from The Mournland. Commissioned directly by the Brelish crown, the Brigade's presence and authority reverberate across the surrounding lands, instilling a sense of guarded stability. Adorned in uniforms bearing their emblem, a fox silhouetted by a silver moon, these disciplined soldiers uphold their duty with unwavering commitment. Yet, beneath the surface of this professional alliance, an undercurrent of tension exists between the Moonfox Brigade, patrolling the rural outskirts, and the Firehawk Legion, who maintain order within the city's boundaries. This friction not only reflects conflicting methodologies and jurisdictions, but also the broader political complexities that engulf Vathirond.

**Narani Laseur**, the enigmatic figurehead of Vathirond, ascended to her position through a veneer of populism that belied her insatiable hunger for power and wealth. Possessing a shrewd ability to capitalize on the city's dire straits, she turned the tragedies of war into her own profiteering enterprise, harvesting the spoils from the devastated Dunvar Valley and the skeletal remains of The Mournlands. Such voracious exploitation bred deep fissures within the social fabric of Vathirond, exacerbating the divide between the haves and have-nots. Underpinning her reign, the **Firehawk Legion**, a cadre of Darguun Goblinoid mercenaries, serve as the city's ostensible protectors. Yet, beneath the surface, they are the clawed arm of Laseur's cabal, bending the rule of law to the will of their matron, enforcing her decrees without question, and ensuring her tainted prosperity thrives amidst the ruins.

**The Goonswarm**, Vathirond's most formidable salvage gang, casts an imposing shadow over the battered expanse of the Dunvar Valley. Their territory spans the sprawling mudfields and makeshift camps that house scores of migrant workers, many refugees from The Mournlands or displaced from the ravages of the Last War. At the helm of this formidable operation is the indomitable Evalin MacTanni, a figure equally feared and respected. Her unyielding ruthlessness and sharp cunning transformed the Goonswarm from a ragtag assembly of scavengers into a well-oiled salvage machine. MacTanni's charisma has turned the Dunvar Valley into a kingdom of salvage, extracting wealth from the wreckage, remnants, and refuse of battles past. The scars of war have become her treasure trove, promising riches to those desperate enough to risk life and limb amidst the rusted debris and lingering dangers that permeate the region.

**The Odd Fellows** exert their influence in the labyrinthine alleys and shadowy corners of Vathirond. This once-disorganized Thieves Guild, composed of neighborhood gangs, banded together in the wake of the city's devastation during the Last War, forging order from chaos. Under their flag, smuggling routes thrived, clandestine gambling dens buzzed, and a vibrant black market emerged from the ashes. The Odd Fellows have become an intricate part of Vathirond's post-war fabric, operating as a shadow government within the city, navigating its underworld with unparalleled savvy. However, this rise to power has sparked tension and conflict, particularly with the Goonswarm. These two formidable entities now stand at odds, clashing over the invaluable territory and the highly lucrative market of "salvaged" goods that the ruined city and its surrounding landscapes provide. The Odd Fellows, masters of stealth and subterfuge, are always prepared to play the long game, their moves as unpredictable as the city's uncertain future.

**The Korranberg Institute for Mournlands Research (KIMR)** is a beacon of hope amidst the ruins of Vathirond. Occupying the remains of the once grand Lonteu Opera House in the Crown of Sirens, KIMR is a huddle of academic rigor and unwavering determination. Comprised of intrepid scholars, skilled wizards, and a cadre of brave souls unafraid to probe the enigmatic Mournlands, they have transformed this erstwhile cultural edifice into a nerve center of knowledge and discovery. Amidst the grandeur of fallen arches and dilapidated galleries, they pursue a mission that's as daunting as it is crucial: to understand the Mournlands, to peel back the layers of mystery shrouding it, and, ultimately, to unearth ways to heal the scars left by the Last War. The scholars of KIMR, though working in the face of unimaginable devastation and under the shadow of the Mournlands, persist, their pursuits lighting the path towards potential restoration and redemption for Vathirond and perhaps all of Khorvaire.

<div class="text-bg-light mb-3 p-3 lead">
And there you have it – the bones and sinews of a city teetering on the brink, waiting to rise from the ashes or be forever consumed. Should your curiosity be piqued by these broad strokes of Vathirond, I'd be more than willing to delve into the labyrinth of adventures and encounters that were conceived within its Crowns. It's a testament to the city's captivating allure that I find myself yearning to return to its scarred yet resilient streets in any future explorations of Eberron.

Your thoughts and queries are the lifeblood that fuels this chronicle. Don't hesitate to reach out via Twitter if Vathirond has caught your imagination or if you're grappling with burning questions. Your engagement breathes life into these words. Here's to shared adventures and stories yet untold. Until next time, Cheers!

title: Malevolent Monsters - The Mind Reaver

description: The Mind Reaver, a chaos driven twisted creature from the Underdark.
---

In the thrilling realm of Dungeons & Dragons, where weI've crafted epic battles and monstrous foes, I'm thrilled to introduce my latest creation, the Mind Reaver. This new entity is a nightmarish variation of the classic Mind Flayer. It's not just a twisted iteration but an entirely different beast that thrives in chaos and malice, unlike its lawful evil kin. The Mind Reaver promises to surprise, challenge, and instill a sense of dread in even the most seasoned adventurers. As I bring this unpredictable creature into our stories, I aim to add another layer of depth to our collective adventures. So get ready, fellow Dungeon Masters and players, as we dive headlong into the chaotic and terrifying world of the Mind Reaver.

## The Mind Reaver

The process of creating a Mind Flayer is a precise and delicate one, carefully conducted by Illithid elders in their dark and hidden laboratories beneath the earth. However, when this procedure is tainted by volatile energies, the resulting creature is a grotesque and chaotic aberration known as a Mind Reaver.

Unlike their fully formed brethren, Mind Reavers bear the hideous marks of their flawed creation. Their bodies are twisted and warped, with elongated limbs, a disproportionate number of writhing tentacles, and skin mottled with pulsating patches of unnatural color. Their eyes, usually two in number, can vary in placement and quantity, giving them an unsettling gaze that seems to penetrate into one's very soul.

### Lore

Mind Reavers are an anathema within Illithid society. Their chaotic tendencies make them unpredictable and dangerously volatile, both to enemies and their own kind. As such, they are typically exiled upon their creation, sent to wander the Underdark or any place far from the organized colonies of the Mind Flayers.

Though they lack the refined psionic prowess of a typical Mind Flayer, these creatures are not to be underestimated. Their chaotic nature fuels a raw, unrestrained psychic power, making them erratic but potent foes. This, coupled with their innate bitterness towards a world that has rejected them, makes them exceedingly dangerous.

It's rumored that these creatures, despite their volatile and chaotic behavior, hold a profound hatred for their fully-formed Illithid brethren, and tales speak of them rallying other Underdark denizens to their cause. In rare instances, they have been known to form aberrant 'colonies' of their own, bringing together various misfit and outcast creatures of the Underdark under their warped rule.

In the end, the Mind Reaver is a tragic figure. Born of a process meant to create perfection, they are instead left as imperfect beings in a world that shuns them. Yet it's this imperfection, this deviation from the norm, that makes them a force to be reckoned with. One should be wary when traversing the dark recesses of the Underdark, for you never know when you might cross paths with a Mind Reaver.

{% include monsters/mind_reaver.md %}

## Using  Mind Reavers
The Mind Reaver, with its Challenge Rating (CR) of 5, serves as an ideal boss monster for low-level parties or as a group threat for more advanced players. It embodies the very essence of malevolent chaos, destruction, resentment, and bitter betrayal, providing a gripping and intense encounter in any campaign. Whether it's the primary antagonist in a dark story arc or a surprise menace lurking in the depths of your dungeon, the Mind Reaver promises an unforgettable encounter.

### Adventure Seed Ideas

1. **City of Nightmares**: City leaders are experiencing sudden, violent episodes at night, instigating chaos, with a Mind Reaver secretly causing it all from the sewers. The party must brave the depths, confront the Mind Reaver, and halt the spreading pandemonium.

2. **The Lost Expedition**: An adventuring party went missing in a series of mysterious caves. Their last message spoke of strange creatures with tentacles and psychic powers.

3. **Cult of Chaos**: A cult has been attempting to summon a Mind Reaver to spread chaos and destruction in the region.

4. **The Mind-locked Prison**: The heroes are imprisoned in a psychic jail by a Mind Reaver and must use their wits to escape.

5. **The Mad Mage**: A mage driven to chaos and destruction by a Mind Reaver's psychic influence threatens a peaceful village.

6. **Raiders from the Underdark**: Mind Reavers lead a Drow Outcast raiding party from the Underdark, wreaking havoc in the countryside. They have been kidnapping victims to create more of their vile kind.

7. **The Bitter Betrayal**: A once-trusted ally turns out to be controlled by a Mind Reaver disguised as servant, plotting the downfall of the local government.

8. **The Abyssal Portal**: Strange creatures are terrorizing the countryside, seemingly appearing out of nowhere. A Mind Reaver plans to open a portal to the Abyss, aiming to let chaotic entities into the realm.

9. **Revenge of the Mind Slaves**: People who were once enthralled by a Mind Reaver are now free and seeking vengeance, but they fear the creature's return. Can the party heal and integrate the former captives and end the threat of the Mind Reaver's return.

10. **The Relic of Chaos**: An ancient artifact that holds the essence of a powerful Mind Reaver has been stolen, threatening to unleash the beast if not recovered in time.

title: Reimagining the Mark Option in D&D 5E - Empowering Martial Characters
date: 2023-05-27 10:28

description: Explore a proposed revision to D&D 5E's "Mark" option to boost martial gameplay, simplifying rules and enriching combat dynamics.
---
Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition's Dungeon Master’s Guide (DMG) presents an array of optional rules that, regrettably, often recede into obscurity. One such overlooked provision, nestled within Chapter 9 of the DMG, is the "Mark" option. This rule, seemingly promising on the surface, is burdened with unnecessary complexities, offering marginal benefit.

{% include imageframe.html
  figure_class="float-end ms-4 clearfix"
  src="/assets/img/OpportunityAttack_480x720.jpg"
  alt="A fighter slashing at the back of an enemy as they run away. Black and white line art."
  width="480" height="720"
  caption="No Running!"
 %}

The original Mark option requires a character to 'mark' a target each turn and diligently keep track of this choice. The upside? The ability to execute an Opportunity Attack without consuming a reaction - a beneficial yet sporadic occurrence. However, the tediousness of marking a target every round, coupled with the relative rarity of Opportunity Attacks, seems needlessly complex and limiting, making this rule an unwieldy addition to many campaigns.

Nevertheless, with a sprinkle of creativity and modification, we believe this rule harbors the potential to significantly enhance the gameplay experience, especially for martial characters. Here, we propose a tweak aimed at simplifying the Mark option and boosting its relevance in melee combat dynamics:

> ## Mark (Improved)
> This option amplifies the capability of melee combatants to challenge each other with opportunity attacks.
>
> An Opportunity Attack against a creature that the attacker has struck with a Melee Attack since their last turn does not consume the attacker's reaction. Characters are still limited to one Opportunity Attack per round.
{:.d-flex}
{:.flex-column}
{:.rule}
{:.simple-rule}

This alteration doesn't bog down gameplay with added choices, applies uniformly to all melee characters, provides the most substantial impact to characters with multiple attacks, and spares the added complexity of tracking marked targets. It retains the viability of Opportunity Attacks while synergizing well with abilities such as Protect, Intercept, Hide in Plain Sight, and many others, making martial characters, particularly fighters, far more dynamic.

That's my take on this potential enhancement to the Mark rule, but what about you? Do you see the value this could bring to your game? We're all ears for your thoughts, so let's start a conversation.

description: Dive into D&D's magic with our guide on Places of Power. Explore how to find, attune, and harness these unique locations to enhance your game.
---
The untamed forces of magic in Dungeons and Dragons have long held the power to both awe and terrify, a duality echoed in the narrative threads of fantasy literature. This house rule invites players to embrace this paradox, offering a high-stakes opportunity to amplify their spells beyond conventional limits. But, this isn't a risk to be taken lightly; mastery comes with potential for both magnificent success and cataclysmic failure. This high-risk, high-reward dynamic is not universal, but rather tethered to Places of Power - locations within the game world steeped in raw, wild magical energy. Here, spellcasters can attempt to weave this abundant power into their own spells, pushing the boundaries of what they could usually achieve. However, the road to arcane supremacy is fraught with peril, and the volatile energies of these places can lead to unexpected and dangerous consequences.

As a Dungeon Master, this house rule offers a unique narrative tool to manage the use of these amplified abilities and build compelling encounters. Villains, drawn to the immense power offered by these locations, might set up their lairs in Places of Power, adding an extra layer of challenge and strategy to confrontations. Moreover, these magical nexuses can become focal points in your campaign, driving the narrative as players might actively seek these places out, eager to tap into their vast potential. This is not just a rule - it is a lore, a plot device, and a tantalizing challenge all rolled into one, offering new avenues for character development and world-building. Embark on this arcane journey, and let your game be infused with the volatile and awe-inspiring power of raw magic.

## Places of Power

Places of Power are distinctive locations saturated with arcane or divine energies. A competent spellcaster can tap into these energies, enhancing their own spells and abilities. To utilize a Place of Power, a spellcaster must first identify a location that aligns with their specific magical or divine influence. Following discovery, the caster must engage in a period of study and attunement to effectively harness the location's power. Place types may or may not make a difference in terms of access and attunement, as determined by the DM.  

Here are the common types of Places of Power:

* **Leyline Nodes:** Leyline Nodes serve as focal points where natural currents of arcane energy converge, forming reservoirs of magical energy. Wizards can utilize these nodes, but only if their school of magic aligns with the particular energy of the node.

* **Holy Sites:** These locations bear a distinct significance to a specific god, religion, or holy ideal. Clerics can tap into these sites, provided their divine domain aligns with the site's sacred affiliation.

* **Primal Refuges:** These are areas that brim with the untouched, primal energies of nature, drawing power directly from the Feywild. Druids can utilize these refuges, but their Circle must align with the refuge's primal energy.

* **Pure Essence:** These locations have been previously inhabited by potent supernatural entities, and their residual essence remains infused within these places. Sorcerers can tap into these locations, but their bloodline must correspond to the essence of the entity that once inhabited the location.

## Finding and Attuning to a Place of Power
Places of power may be detected with the Detect Magic spell. Alternatively a combination of a study of the history of the place or careful examination may allow a History or Investigation check to realize a location is a place of power.

Once discovered, a spellcaster can take a short rest and attempt to attune to a Place of Power by making a check using their primary spellcasting ability. The DC for this check is set by the DM and typically ranges from 10 for common or well-known Places of Power, to 20 or more for extremely rare or unique locations. Importantly, attuning to a location does not count against the character's maximum item attunement limit. However, this attunement isn't permanent and may fade over time, necessitating reattunement after a significant period.

Remember, Places of Power should be treated as significant elements within your world, and their discovery and utilization should carry corresponding narrative weight.

## Rarity & Effects
Places of Power in D&D can enhance, modify or even provide entirely new abilities, offering a boost to spellcasters and creatures alike. DMs are encouraged to get creative with the effects of these power locations, making their campaigns even more engaging. Many wizards position their towers, creatures make lairs, and churches build their foundations upon these mystical spots, all seeking to harness their power. 

Places of Power have a rarity system, akin to that of magic items, ranging from Common to Legendary. Here's a brief overview of each category:

1. **Common:** These Places of Power are frequently encountered, and their effects, while beneficial, are relatively minor. Examples might include an area providing something akin to the Guidance spell or Song of Rest ability once per day. Roadside inns, small shrines, and minor monster lairs often occupy these sites.

2. **Uncommon:** Less common than their counterparts, these Places of Power provide slightly more potent effects or a broader range of minor effects. Typical examples might include Spell Weaving (see below), halving the time of spell scribing or alchemical production, providing an extra hit die of healing during a short rest once a day, or a small bonus to attack. Large shrines or small chapels, houses of healing, fortifications, libraries, and lairs often occupy these sites.

3. **Rare:** Rare Places of Power are challenging to find, but their beneficial effects are considerably more potent and impactful. Typical effects might include providing an increase to hit points, resistance to a type of damage, sustaining low-level spell effects, doubling healing, and more. Churches, organizational headquarters, strong castles, and powerful monster lairs often occupy these sites.

4. **Very Rare:** These Places of Power are seldom encountered. Their effects are significantly powerful, offering substantial benefits to those able to tap into them. These sites may provide regeneration, multiple resistances, spell resistance, control of regional weather, and more. Grand temples, state capitals, powerful citadels, and ancient dragon lairs often occupy these sites.

5. **Legendary:** The most elusive of all, Legendary Places of Power offer truly awe-inspiring and mind-bending abilities. They're often tied to significant historical or world events and form the stuff of myths and legends. These sites provide total damage resistance or some damage immunities, combinations of spell-like abilities, the ability to alter terrain or control animals or beings in the region. Locations are almost always unique and heavily contested, leaving a legacy of woe.

The possibilities are truly limitless, and Dungeon Masters are encouraged to get creative. Perhaps these locations house portals, serve as communion points for Warlocks and their patrons, or even provide coveted power sources for diligent Wizards. They could also imbue lair-dwelling monsters with abilities they might not typically possess. Use these Places of Power to enhance your game, provide players with intriguing new goals and mysteries, and above all, enjoy the journey. Gear up to elevate your gaming experience!

### Spell Weaving (Uncommon)

When a spellcaster is within an attuned Place of Power, they may tap into its energy to enhance their spellcasting. As part of casting a spell, the caster can choose add one or more Metamagic-like effects. To do so, the caster must make a spellcasting ability check. The DC for this check is 10 + the level of the spell being cast + 2 for each Metamagic effect selected.

The available effects at a Place of Power typically include Distant Spell, Empower Spell, Extended Spell, and Subtle Spell, as per the descriptions provided in the Sorcerer class, but with references to Charisma replaced by the caster's primary spellcasting ability.

If the character fails the check, the spell fails and the caster loses the spell slot. Additionally, if they fail the roll by 5 or more, they suffer one randomly rolled spell failure plus one additional failure effect for every additional 5 points they fail the Check by. 

Roll a d6 to determine the type of failure:

**Spell Failure**

1. **Mana Burn:** The caster loses a spell slot of the spell's level. If they have no more spell slots of that level, the player may choose to lose a spell slot of the next highest level, or two slots from the level below - it's the player's choice. If none are available, roll again.
2. **Exhaustion:** The caster gains a level of exhaustion as they've overtaxed their body.
3. **Soul Shock:** The caster has disadvantage on all checks with their primary casting ability until they complete a long rest. Rolling this effect again extends the duration by one additional long rest.
4. **Sensory Overload:** The caster is blinded, deafened, or loses the ability to speak (player's choice) until the end of their next long rest. Rolling this effect again allows the player to select another effect or extends the duration of an existing effect by one additional long rest.
5. **System Shock:** The caster must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC 10 + spell level) or become stunned until the end of their next turn. Rolling this effect again means the condition lasts until the wizard makes a successful save, repeating this save at the end of each turn. If this effect is rolled a 3rd time, roll again instead.
6. **Mana Feedback:** The caster takes 1d8 force damage per level of the spell they attempted to cast.

As always, adjust this system as necessary to fit your campaign and your players' preferences.

#### Sorcerer Metamagic in a Place of Power

When a sorcerer attuned to a Place of Power uses a Metamagic ability, they reduce the Sorcery Point cost by 1. If this adjustment would bring the cost below 1, there's still a 50% chance they expend 1 Sorcery Point. Sorcerers can choose to use the standard Place of Power rules instead, particularly if they're out of Sorcery Points or willing to embrace the risk.

description: This post unravels the history of D&D's Hit Points (HP), from wargaming roots to 5th Ed's abstract system. And it looks into what the heck hit points are supposed to be anyway.
---
The conversation around what Hit Points (HP) are and what they represent in Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) is a cyclical one. It's a concept that periodically bubbles up in the tabletop role-playing game (TTRPG) community, like an ancient dragon in its cyclical slumber, and we seem to be in the midst of another awakening.

It's no surprise that understanding HP often seems like trying to learn Draconic without a spell of Comprehend Languages. Table Top Roleplaying Games are narrative adventures, so we naturally want to weave a compelling story around every game element. And therein lies the enigma of Hit Points - no matter how you narrate them, you're likely to walk into a wall of confusion and pile of contradictions.

## A Historical Perspective

Many D&D elements, including HP, sprung from the hobby's wargaming roots. In those days, units usually had a defensive score and an offensive score. The outcomes were binary: units either lived or died. But when these concepts morphed into the individual tactical combat that defined Original D&D (OD&D), there was a need for a way to track the progress towards defeat, thus giving birth to Armor Class (AC) and Hit Points (HP).

In OD&D, AC denoted how challenging you were to hit, and HP showed how close you were to defeat. The game simply states, "Your hit points determine how hard your character is to kill." And that's it. That's the HP origin story. They're an arbitrary, abstract measurement of how difficult you are to kill and how far along the game is in achieving that.

## The Evolution of HP

Later D&D editions got increasingly philosophical about HP. Advanced D&D acknowledged physical punishment, but clarified that "a significant portion of hit points, especially at higher levels, stands for skill, luck, and/or magical factors." It even said it would be "ridiculous" to assume characters could endure such physical punishment, further emphasizing that HP are not intended to be taken literally.

2nd Edition D&D kept the abstract theme, defining damage as an abstract concept that allows characters to be heroic. It didn't dwell on the semantics of HP. 3rd Edition, on the other hand, leaned into the mechanics and didn't provide a narrative explanation for HP and damage at all. 4th Edition tried to have the best of both worlds, setting a base number of hit points representing "real" damage, while anything over was the old dance of skill, luck, and magic.

By the time 5th edition D&D came around, we're back in the abstract realm, with the game stating, "Hit Points represent a combination of physical and mental durability, the will to live, and luck."

## Hit Points: Setting the Stage, Not defining the Genre

Hit Point mechanics are integral, but the presence of HP doesn't force your game into a specific genre. That job is for the Dungeon Master, who tailors how this mechanic comes into play. For instance, early D&D editions painted a grim, risky scene with low HP and tight damage thresholds, providing a sword-and-sorcery feel. In contrast, 5th Edition, with its generous HP pools and high-damage exploits, resonates with high-fantasy heroics.

Remember, it's not the existence of HP that set these styles; it's their application. As the DM, you have the freedom to adjust this tool to shape your campaign's tone, from injecting grimdark elements into a 5th Edition game by reducing HP, to amping up the heroics in a 1st Edition game by increasing HP totals. At the end of the day, HP is a vital but flexible aspect of the D&D universe.

## Hit Points: Tools, Not Shackles

It's crucial to remember that Hit Points are a mechanic, not a set of shackles for the DM. They have their boundaries and are not designed to simulate everything could befall a character. Every edition of D&D underscores this, suggesting that the DM delineates these limits.

For instance, if a character decides to take a dip in a lava pool or plunge from a mile-high cliff, many DMs might opt not to roll damage, deeming these situations unsurvivable. In such cases, the official material often advises DMs to declare character death outright, instead of getting tangled in the mire of damage dice. *However, if these drastic scenarios occur frequently in your game, it might be worth reassessing your game design.*

On the flip side, some DMs might channel a superhero vibe, letting characters brush off falls from great heights. That's equally valid. As with any ruling in a tabletop RPG, maintaining an internally consistent world is the important part.

The bottom line? Understanding the tone of your game and setting appropriate limits is key when navigating the world of Hit Points. Keep this in mind as you weave your epic tales of adventure.

## Living with the HP Conundrum

Trying to define Hit Points is like grappling with a Mind Flayer — it's a sure path to madness. Make it too abstract, and you create a narrative disconnect. Make it too literal, and you grapple with the absurdities of surviving a lava bath or healing from the brink of death overnight.

In my humble opinion, D&D intends for players to embrace the vagueness of Hit Points. They're not 'meat points' or a measure of your plot armor, but more an abstraction of your character's struggle to survive. Like most time travel plotlines, it's nonsensical. So, just wave your hand, enjoy the game, and let the Hit Points fall where they may. Their purpose is to serve the adventure, the narrative, and ultimately, the fun. Because, in the end, who needs a physics lesson in the thermal dynamics of lava when you can have a daring escape from a volcano instead? 

Now get out there and run some great games!

Launching a new Dungeons & Dragons campaign is no small feat. It requires not only the arduous task of finding players, but also identifying those who are the perfect fit for your envisioned adventure. Even before delving into character backgrounds, safety tools, or other vital session zero elements, a Dungeon Master's first hurdle is convincing potential players to invest their precious time and energy into the unfolding saga. This initial step bears striking similarity to pitching a fresh product or service. Just as entrepreneurs entice investors with the promise of innovation and value, DMs need to captivate potential players with a compelling campaign concept. Enter the Pitch Deck - a tool commonly used in the business world, but equally potent in setting the stage for a thrilling D&D campaign.

Indeed, a Pitch Deck isn't mandatory. You could create a written summary instead. The advantage of a deck, however, is its brevity and focus on essentials. Regardless of format, the aim stays the same. We'll conclude with a template to help you craft your own pitch, be it a Deck or a Summary.

## What is a Pitch Deck?

A pitch deck is a short presentation that shows off your unique game idea. It gives people a sneak peek into your game's style, story, changes to rules, schedule, and other key parts that make your game special.

Although your D&D game doesn't need money from investors, a pitch deck is still very useful. It helps you get people excited to play and willing to spend their valuable time on your game.


## Creating a D&D Campaign Pitch Deck

The contents of a pitch deck can vary based on firm a concept the DM has for the game they're looking to run, but it often includes several key elements. First, it establishes the premise, tone, and style of the game, providing relevant examples. Second, it delves into how the party will interact with each other and their surrounding world. Third, it outlines how the game will engage with its mechanics. Finally, it sets certain baseline boundaries and expected norms within the group, laying the groundwork for future collaboration or safety tools. 

### The Campaign Pitch Summary

**The essence of your pitch lies in just one slide - this is it!** Captivating your audience involves inciting curiosity for more, so focus on broad strokes and highlights. Tease the plot, evoke the action, and convey the tone of the game. If the players you're pitching to aren't familiar with each other, share a few insights about your DMing style, the humor at the table, and the particular rules you're implementing. Save the details for follow-up questions or Session Zero. Your primary goal is to pique the players' interest and steer their thinking in the right direction from the start.

Here's what I recommend:

* **Campaign Title and Tagline:** Consider examples like "Rime of the Frostmaiden: A chilling struggle for survival in the heart of fantasy horror" or "Trouble on the Triboar Trail: Frontier justice meets rugged survival in the untamed Sword Mountains."
* **Setting:** Include a brief mention of the setting, landscape, travel logistics, or how players will interact with the world.
* **System:** Outline the system, edition, any specific versions, and sources the game will use. Example: "5e D&D, minor house rules apply. Core books, Xanathar's, & Tasha's acceptable. No Unearthed Arcana, please."
* **Inspiration:** Reference a few films, books, or other media that capture the campaign's intended ambiance. If relevant, consider including a film-like rating for the campaign.
* **Campaign Style:** Indicate how Roleplaying, Lore, Action, and Combat will factor into the campaign. You might also want to mention the degree of consequence in the game. Adding a note about humor's place can be helpful – e.g., "Significant lore and roleplay. Light humor. Minimize metagaming." or "Intense lore and roleplaying, grim-dark setting, no phones at the table."
* **Schedule & Venue:** Be upfront about your proposed schedule, as this can often be a hurdle for campaigns. Also, specify whether the game will be online, in-person, or a mix. This is akin to "the ask" in pitches - be explicit. E.g., "Online via Roll20, weekly for 3 hours, Saturdays 5pm EST. Please commit to regular attendance", "In-person at my home, biweekly Sundays at 2pm, flexible attendance."

### Additional Topics

The Campaign Pitch Summary is the essential part of your game pitch. Ideally, if your presentation includes more than one slide, the first one should captivate your players enough to prompt them to view the subsequent slides. The following are some additional slides that could provide players with more context. Out of these, I'd highly recommend "Game Boundaries & Tools." While many TTRPG players refer to these as Safety & Consent, I believe the term "Boundaries" is more apt.

**Suggested Additional Slides or Topics:**

* **Tools & Resources:** If your game is online or employs extensive tooling, this is the place to list those out. DnDBeyond, VTT, Text Chat, Voice Chat, and any other tools players will be using during the game. Differentiate between optional and mandatory tools. You might also consider mentioning your boundaries regarding other tools.

* **Table Styles:** If you have specific expectations about game flow or table norms, outline them here. Whether you use an hourglass during play, ask players not to offer advice during others' turns, or expect players to select their spells before their turn - these details belong on this slide.

* **Optional and House Rules:** House Rules are quite common in D&D, and even the core rules offer different variations a DM might adopt. Highlight these here, especially if a rule significantly impacts certain classes or players.

* **Baseline Boundaries:** As touched on earlier, this would be my first choice for an additional slide after the summary. Boundaries are crucial in TTRPGs and can significantly affect the game's enjoyment. While DMs should undoubtedly discuss player boundaries in session zero, it's also essential to establish baseline expectations or non-negotiables ahead of that discussion. This sets a clear foundation and prevents any false sense of flexibility during session zero. For instance, I'm not fond of overly sexualized or evil play; it doesn't mesh with my style. Your preferences and the nature of your game may differ. If you plan to run a particularly grim setting like Dark Sun, players should be aware of that before session zero. This slide is the place for such disclosures.

## Other Resources

Creating a TTRPG Pitch Deck can be as elaborate or as straightforward as the DM prefers. Personally, I enjoy developing a deck adorned with images to add a bit of flair to the pitch. However, a text summary could be just as effective. Choose the format that suits you, your game, and the target players best.

Here are a few useful resources:

* [**Pitch Deck Template**]({% link assets/downloads/TTRPG_Pitch_Deck_Template.pptx %}) I've designed this simple pitch deck template, complete with prompts for a one-page summary. It's provided in PowerPoint format, but you can upload it to Google Drive or open it with LibreOffice.
    * For a real-world example, take a look at this [Rime of the Frostmaiden Pitch Deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1kjaK9Q9p90P54E2ITZPf0DHGyaZZMHXYAg52Ar19zp4/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"} I used for my campaign.
* [**Writing a One-Page Campaign Guide**](https://slyflourish.com/one_page_campaign_guide.html){:target="_blank"} by Mike 'Sly Flourish' Shea offers another perspective. While I prefer using the pitch to pique interest and then this tool to provide more context prior to session zero, you could begin with this if you've already garnered sufficient interest.
* [**Pitching Your Campaign**](https://youtu.be/MtH1SP1grxo){:target="_blank"} by Matt Colville is a fantastic video from his Running the Game series.

## Conclusion

Getting player investment from the start can be a powerful tool for launching your campaign on the right foot. It not only helps identify players who are a good fit for your style of game,  but also directs their creative energies from the get-go. While session zero tends to get the limelight, we shouldn't overlook engaging the right players even before we reach that point. Pitching your game in a fun and engaging way can help you navigate past common challenges by aligning with the right players from the beginning.

Now get out there and run some great games!

---
Delving into the oft-debated mechanics of Dungeons and Dragons (D&D), it's hard to overlook the perennial discussion points: Armor Class (AC) and Hit Points (HP). While they may seem simple on the surface, these fundamental aspects of D&D often engender misunderstandings and heated debates. Armor Class, though instinctively viewed as a gauge of whether a character is struck or not, is in fact a more abstract concept. Following my recent post [What are HPs in D&D anyway?]({% link _posts/2023-06-02-what-are-hit-points-in-dnd.md %}), it's fitting that we now unpack the intricacies of AC and its symbiotic relationship with HP - the two crucial pillars that underpin the game's combat system.

  height="720"
  caption="Rock, Paper, Greatsword!"
%}
## The Genesis of Armor Class

The genesis of AC in D&D dates back to the game's wargaming origins, where combat was typically a binary concept - either a unit was victorious or it was defeated. But as D&D emerged, focusing on individual combat encounters instead of unit battles, a more intricate system was called for. To build and sustain tension for individual characters throughout an adventure, a 'tug of war' mechanic was introduced, wherein the game sought to quantify both a character's resilience HP and the time needed to overcome them. Hence, Armor Class was born.

In Original D&D (OD&D), AC represented the challenge of landing a damaging hit on your character. However, it left the concept of a 'hit' undefined. Was it a sword deflecting off plate armor? A deft evasion? A streak of divine luck? The rulebook intentionally remained silent on these specifics, emphasizing AC's inherent abstraction.

It's important to appreciate that the architects of D&D were well aware of the 'swinginess' of D20s. They understood that setting up a damage over time mechanic, regulated by the frequency of hits and the strength of attacks, was the most effective way to offset this inherent randomness. This allowed Adventures to be risky, but not random. An incredibly important element of TTRPG game design, if you wanted players to invest in their characters.

## Armor Class: Defining its Abstraction

As the D&D editions evolved, the ambiguity of AC continued. Some players interpreted it as purely physical protection - the better the armor, the higher the AC. But armor could be bulky and restrictive. How would that account for the nimbleness of an unarmored monk? Or the ability of a rogue to evade attacks? Here's where the abstraction comes into play.

AC is not just about physical armor. It encapsulates all the factors that might prevent a character from taking damage - natural agility, training, magical protection, divine favor, sheer luck, and yes, wearing a sturdy suit of armor. But, like HP, it's not literally any of these things. It's a mechanical tool that enables players to visualize their characters surviving in a dangerous world.

## The Dance of AC and HP

The relationship between AC and HP forms the basis of the D&D Damage Over Time system. A character's AC determines how likely they are to evade damage, while HP defines how much damage they can withstand before being defeated.

To illustrate, imagine a heavily armored knight (high AC, high HP) and a lightly armored rogue (lower AC, lower HP). The knight, with their superior armor, can absorb more hits before their HP depletes. In contrast, the rogue relies on their agility to avoid hits, mitigating the need for a large HP pool. Neither is invincible - the knight might face a foe with an accurate strike, and the rogue could encounter an enemy with an area attack that's hard to dodge.

However, it's vital to understand that AC isn't a literal damage reduction. A higher AC doesn't directly decrease the damage you take - but higher AC does mean you'll take less damage over time. In this way, the single simple AC value serves the narrative role of damage reduction, as miss, or just toughing it out. Similarly, a high HP doesn't mean you can shrug off a dragon's fire breath - it represents your ability to avoid the worst of the attack, keep going despite the pain, or recover quickly.

## Unshackling the Abstraction

It's worth repeating that both AC and HP are mechanical tools for the game, not narrative shackles. They offer a game-friendly way to handle the complex, chaotic nature of combat without bogging down in ultra-realism that could hinder gameplay. 

As the DM, it's your job to help the mechanics flow into the narrative to best fit your campaign's tone. You could describe the dodges and near misses for a rogue with high AC, or the punishing blows that a knight absorbs through heavy armor and sheer toughness. In other words, the mechanics tension and provides momentum to a scene without getting in the way of the narrative tone of the game.

## Conclusion: Embrace the Abstract

Attempting to pin down AC in literal terms is a pure madness. Much like HPs, AC is best understood as an abstraction. Representative of various factors contributing to your character's survivability in combat. It's not simply the quality of a character's armor, nor their ability to dodge, but a mix of physical, skillful, and even supernatural factors. It's all of it, or none of it depending on how it fits the tone of your game.

Rules play a pivotal role in defining the tone, pace, and action in a TTRPG. At some point, most D&D fans question the abstract nature of AC and HP, wondering why armor doesn't directly mitigate damage. While damage reduction systems can be enjoyable, D&D offers two broad alternatives: reduce damage per hit or leverage AC to apply damage less frequently. Both approaches yield similar outcomes, but AC achieves this without adding further mathematical steps, underlining its design simplicity.

And so, dear reader, as with Hit Points, I encourage you to embrace the abstract nature of Armor Class. It's a tool, a game mechanic designed to simulate the unpredictability and risk of combat in a fantasy world. It's there help build a narrative through game play, because you don't need a lesson in impact physics, you need a trilling duel in the streets of Neverwinter!  Use it as such, and weave it into your narrative in a way that enhances your game, not restricts it. Happy gaming!

Embrace the dread, harness the horror, and let your adventurers feel the chill of the Mind Reaver's shadow with the introduction of the Rage Husk.

## Rage Husks
In the labyrinthine depths of chaotic realms, there dwell malevolent entities known as a [Mind Reaver]({% link _posts/2023-05-24-monster-mind-reaver.md %}). These beings, aberrations formed from failed attempts to create Mind Flayers, weave their own brand of dark, psychic terror. It's in their destructive wake that the unfortunate victims are morphed into the monstrosities known as Rage Husks. 

Robbed of their sanity and consciousness by the Mind Reavers, the victims are left with nothing but an echo of the pain and fury experienced in their final cognizant moments. This torment is reshaped into a fearsome determination to destroy, creating a formidable, mindless husk fueled by pure rage. 

Rage Husks are often found scattered across the aftermath of a Mind Reaver attack, a chilling reminder of their terrifying power. Furthermore, within the treacherous lairs of these vile creatures, the Mind Reavers maintain a fragile control over the Rage Husks, utilizing them as part of their defensive strategies. As your group delves deeper into these chaotic territories, brace yourself for encounters with these tortured beings, their relentless pursuit a testament to the horrors of the Mind Reaver's touch.

### Mastering Minions: A Page from D&D's 4e Playbook 

Calling all Dungeon Masters seeking to elevate their combat encounters! Let's revisit a technique from D&D's 4th edition that's making a modern comeback, including in [MCDM's 'Flee Mortals'](https://shop.mcdmproductions.com/collections/flee-mortals-the-mcdm-monster-book){:target="_blank"} book: the mighty Minion rule. This simple rule is your key to creating scenes of epic, heroic battles: minions, despite behaving like standard monsters, fall with just one successful hit. But don't discard the minion's hit points just yet. These still matter for spells like Sleep, which operate based on HP.

Whether it's a horde of minions, or adding spice to a boss battle, the Minion rule can turn a routine encounter into a memorable tale of heroic warfare. Harness this tool, and let's take your game to the next level!

## Using Rage Husks
Imagine unleashing a torrent of Rage Husks against your unsuspecting party, creating a frantic and intense combat scenario where waves of these formidable yet easily dispatchable enemies push the heroes to their limits. Even the mightiest of warriors can be overwhelmed by sheer numbers, testing not just their strength, but their endurance and tactical acumen as well. Rage Husks also serve as formidable minions when under the control of a powerful adversary like a Mind Reaver, adding a dangerous layer to an already challenging boss fight. But don't limit yourself to what's written here - let your imagination run wild! These psychic zombies could be the consequence of a cursed item, a magical effect gone wrong, or a myriad of other creative plot devices. So go ahead, unleash the Rage Husks and let the heroic chaos unfold!

### Adventure Seeds
Here are some adventure seeds you can use to incorporate Rage Husks into your adventure.

1. **The Cursed Heirloom:** An antique necklace recently acquired by a noble family is actually a cursed item that transforms its wearers into Rage Husks. Can the party find a way to reverse the curse before the entire family is affected?

2. **The Madness Below:** A mining town reports strange occurrences in the depths of their mines – miners turning into Rage Husks. The party must delve into the depths and discover the cause before it's too late.

3. **The Blood Moon Ritual:** During every Blood Moon, a deranged wizard's failed experiments result in the creation of Rage Husks. Can the party stop the wizard before the next moon rise?

4. **The Crumbling Stronghold:** In an ancient fortress, the party finds a horde of Rage Husks, mindlessly guarding something. What secrets are they protecting and can the party uncover them?

5. **The Towering Silence:** An entire city suddenly falls quiet, and an army of Rage Husks are the only residents. The party must uncover what turned the citizens and if there's a way to restore them.

6. **The Lost Expedition:** An archaeological expedition in ancient ruins has disappeared. Their last message spoke of strange, rage-filled creatures. Can the party rescue the lost archaeologists and confront the Rage Husks?

7. **The Wailing Forest:** A haunted forest has started birthing Rage Husks from its mists. The party must find the source of this curse and put an end to it.

8. **The Puppeteer's Game:** A Mind Reaver is using Rage Husks as pawns in its deadly game. Can the party navigate the treacherous lair, defeat the Rage Husks, and stop the Mind Reaver?

9. **The Abandoned Monastery:** Monks of a secluded monastery have become Rage Husks after dabbling with forbidden magic. Can the party cleanse the monastery and break the cycle of transformation?

10. **The Plagued Harbor:** A cursed artifact brought into a bustling port city is slowly transforming its inhabitants into Rage Husks. The party must identify the artifact and break its curse to save the city.

Now get out there and run some great games!

description: Explore the peculiarities of DnD's 5e Death Save system and discover a riveting house rule that adds urgency and deepens gameplay interaction
---
Ever found yourself scratching your head over the peculiarities of the Death Save system in Dungeons and Dragons (DnD) 5e? In particular, how the system seems disconnected from the gameplay and action. It can seem counter-intuitive when zero hit points result in the same outcome for any character, regardless of how they arrived there. The Death Save min-game is the same, whether you've taken a single point of damage, or sustained a catastrophic 150-foot fall. In this post, I aim to dissect the effects of this system on the game and propose a house rule that could shake things up to make the prospect of death an exciting part of the action again.

{% include imageframe.html
  figure_class="float-end ms-4 clearfix p-3 mb-5"
  src="/assets/img/wounded_character_480x720.jpg"
  alt="A wounded warrior crawling on the ground with an arrow sticking out of their side."
  width="480"
  height="720"
%}

## Death Saves in Action

Under the standard 5e DnD rules, when you hit 0 HP you start rolling an unmodified D20 (in most cases) once you hit 0 HP, with a 10 or higher marking a success and a 9 or lower signifying a failure. The odds are slightly in favor of success (55%) than failure (45%) on each roll. After you accumulate three of either outcome, your fate is sealed. So you have a 60% chance of survival, with 18% of those possibly regaining consciousness at 1 HP. Most of these rolls resolve themselves within four turns, although Healing Word makes most of that irrelevant anyway.

While this system allows for players to quickly rejoin the action, it doesn't necessarily add to the excitement of the encounter if reaching 0 HP doesn't carry much risk. In fact, the urgency for other players to save you diminishes as you're not under immediate threat. In fact, I would suggest that this was so devoid of tension that Healing Word was designed the way it was just so you didn't have to interact much with the system. To me, this illustrates how rules can cascade across the system, reducing tension and lessening the importance of team interdependence.

## House Rule: Positive Experiences through Negative Hit Points

I used a House Rule in my 3E days that I think could easily be adapted in 5E. This rule ties the risk of death more closely to the level of action, buts more managed uncertainty back into an encounter, and encourages collective responsibility for the group's survival.

A character can drop negative HP up to their Constitution (CON) score plus level, before they succumb to death. When a character's HP drop below 0 and they haven't yet stabilized, they need to make a CON save. The difficulty class (DC) for this save is equal to their current negative hit point total. Failure results in the character's demise, while a successful save inflicts 1 point of damage. Achieving success on two saves stabilizes the character at their present negative HP value.

Any healing received that doesn't elevate the character to 0 HP or above, counts as a single successful save towards stabilization.

Characters with a negative HP value up to their CON modifier must remain prone and are unable to take bonus actions or reactions until their hit points return  above 0.

*DMs may want to consider removing the Healing Word spell from the game or reducing it to just 1d4 of healing, otherwise this is needless complexity without changing things much.*

## Effect on Play

Does this house rule make the game more "realistic?" Not necessarily. HP in DnD isn't designed to mimic reality. Instead, it sets the tone of the game. Under this rule, stabilization could be achieved after a few successful rolls - relatively simple at -1 HP, but quite challenging at -15 HP.

This rule adds a sense of urgency and heightened risk to the game play. The deeper into the negatives you go, the harder it is for you to recover. Healing now has a significant effect, and the scale of the healing can make a significant difference.  Even Healing Word is helpful, but not as over powered as many lament. 

The heightened stakes inspire more caution as characters become more wounded and make players more invested in their downed teammates' outcomes. Ultimately, this gives players more reasons to interact, and damage becomes more than a countdown to zero HP.

In other words, downing a hero is back to being a significant event in combat, as it should be.

## Conclusion

While the 5e Death Save system serves its purpose, its disconnect from the action in an encounter and lack of urgency can leave some players wanting more. By revisiting an older house rule, I think we can add back some tension, interactivity, and adjust the tone of encounters so they feel like something is at stake again. 

In the end, it's about the feel of your game. Does the standard Death Save system work for your group, or could you benefit from tweaking the rules to spice things up? I'd love to hear your thoughts and experiences, so feel free to reach out to me on Twitter!

As a fan of magically animated minions, I've always felt somewhat limited by the options available in the 5th edition of Dungeons and Dragons. If you're intrigued by the idea of a "pet" class in D&D, your primary option is to become a Necromancer and use Animate Dead. However, the image of a group of shambling undead isn't always what players envision. Given the rich narrative tradition of casters animating objects, constructs, or elements, it's perplexing that these options aren't more prevalent in the game.

To address this conundrum, I've incorporated three new spells into my games. They maintain balance with Animate Dead, offer compelling options for casters, and inject an element of arcane flavor into the gameplay. Allow me to share these additions with you.

> #### Animated Weapon
> *3rd-level Transmutation*
> 
> ___
> 
> - **Casting Time:** 1 minute
> - **Attack/Save:** None
> - **Range:** 10 ft
> - **Components:** V, S, M (A target one-handed melee weapon)
> - **Duration:**  24 hours
> 
> ___
>
> This spell imbues a mundane, one-handed melee weapon with potent magical energy, bringing it to life as an animated weapon. The weapon's statistics and abilities are based on the Flying Sword as described in the Monster Manual, with the following exceptions: The damage and damage type of the animated weapon are determined by the mundane weapon type on which the spell is cast. Additionally, the caster may add their main casting ability modifier to the damage, and the weapon attacks using the caster's melee spell attack bonus.
>
> Once the spell is cast, the animated weapon becomes sentient and recognizes you as its master. It will dutifully follow your commands and fight on your behalf. As a bonus action on your turn, you can mentally command the weapon to move and attack a target within its reach. The weapon will continue attacking that target until it is defeated, it is given a new command, or your concentration on the spell ends. If the weapon's hit points are reduced to 0, it is destroyed, and the spell ends.
>
> The animated weapon remains under your control for the duration of the spell, but it requires your concentration while being commanded. If your concentration is broken, the weapon falls to the ground and becomes an ordinary inanimate weapon until you regain concentration to command it once more.
>
> At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by one weapon die for every two slot levels above 3rd.
{:.stat-block}

> #### Clockwork Servant
> *3rd-level Conjuration*
> 
> ___
> 
> - **Casting Time:** 1 minute
> - **Attack/Save:** None
> - **Range:** 10 ft
> - **Components:** V, S, M (10 gp scrap metal and parts)
> - **Duration:**  24 hours
> 
> ___
>
> This spell creates a loyal clockwork servant, imbuing a significant source of scrap metal. The servant takes on the form and aesthetics determined by the caster's wishes, while inheriting the abilities and characteristics of a Modron. Consult with the game master for the specific statistics of the construct servant.
>
> On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to mentally command any clockwork servant created by this spell, as long as it is within 60 feet of you. If you control multiple servants, you can command any or all of them simultaneously, issuing the same command to each one. You decide the construct's actions and movement for its next turn, or you can give a general command, such as guarding a specific area. In the absence of specific commands, the construct defends itself against hostile creatures. Once a command is given, the servant continues to follow it until its task is complete.
>
> The construct servant remains under your control for 24 hours. After this duration, it degrades into component parts. To maintain control of a construct servant for an additional 24 hours, you must cast this spell on it again before the current 24-hour period ends. When you do so, you can reassert your control over up to four servants you have created with this spell, instead of creating new ones.
>
> If the spell expires, or when destroyed, a caster may recover 1d10 gp worth of material from the remnants of a servant.
>
> **At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can create or reassert control over two additional construct servants for each slot level above 3rd.
{:.stat-block}

> #### Elemental Servant
> *3rd-level Evocation*
> 
> ___
> 
> - **Casting Time:** 1 minute
> - **Attack/Save:** None
> - **Range:** 10 ft
> - **Components:** V, S, M (source element of creature)
> - **Duration:**  24 hours
>
> ___
>
> This spell creates a loyal elemental servant, imbuing a significant source of earth, fire, air, or water within range with arcane animus and the semblance of life. The servant takes the form of a Mud, Steam, or Smoke Mephit, determined by the element used during the casting of the spell. Refer to the game master for the creature's statistics.
>
> On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to mentally command any servant created by this spell as long as it is within 60 feet of you. If you control multiple servants, you can command any or all of them simultaneously, issuing the same command to each one. You decide the creature's actions and movement for its next turn, or you can give a general command, such as guarding a specific chamber or corridor. In the absence of specific commands, the creature defends itself against hostile creatures. Once a command is given, the servant continues to follow it until its task is complete.
>
> The servant remains under your control for 24 hours. After this duration, it no longer obeys your commands. To maintain control of a servant for an additional 24 hours, you must cast this spell on it again before the current 24-hour period ends. When you do so, you can reassert your control over up to four creatures you have animated with this spell, rather than creating new ones.
>
> **At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can animate or reassert control over two additional creatures for each slot level above 3rd.

## Integration and Discovery:
To amplify the sense of adventure and discovery, I weave these spells into the fabric of the narrative instead of presenting them as standard spells accessible to all. I create opportunities for players to uncover these spells through their in-game actions. They might discover them as forgotten wisdom within a concealed library, earn them as accolades for gaining admission into a renowned wizard's guild, or retrieve them from the ancient scrolls nestled in a formidable dragon's treasure trove. By tying the procurement of these spells to the storyline, I instill an extra layer of intrigue and thrill, enriching my players' journey. I think you can too.

## Conclusion
These spells open some fun possibilities for arcane spellcasters, providing players the opportunity to control flavorful arcane servants. With a sprinkle of creativity, you could even extend these spells to encompass additional schools of magic. Remember to find fun ways to weave these into your campaign, making them a rewarding part of the adventure. If concerns about power creep arise, you can always introduce a material component cost or other means to regulate the spell's use within the world. Ultimately, I believe players seeking this type of interaction will find these spells tremendously enjoyable.

Now get out there and run some great games!

title: Narrative Landscapes - More Engaging TTRPG Travel

The art of travel in Tabletop Roleplaying Games remains a perennial favorite in community discussions. Despite my earlier posts on constructing [Perilous Journeys in D&D 5e]({% link _posts/2021-07-13-perilous-journeys-in-5e-p1.md %}), the conversation must go beyond mere obstacles and challenges. The true crux lies in the marriage of narrative and geography - a fusion that is underscored yet often lacks actionable guidance. So, how can we elevate the routine task of terrain description into a thrilling spark for player immersion? Let's dive in.

Traditional narrative often falls into one of two traps: outlining the minutiae of geography or focusing heavily on terrain-oriented challenges. But both miss out on an essential element: potential adventure and side quests within the landscape. This bridge is exactly what we aim to build today.

## Landscape as a Gateway to Adventure

When narrating geography, it's not just about describing the environment. The landscape is an entity in itself, teeming with tales of bygone eras, potential adventures, and hidden secrets. Incorporating these elements into your narrative can make your players’ journey far more compelling. 

Let's say your adventurers are heading to Phandalin. Instead of describing it as a simple pathway towards the mountains, through increasingly steep hills, we can breathe life into this journey. Imagine instead: "You follow a narrow yet well-trodden road, winding its way towards distant, hulking mountains, snaking through gentle, tree-speckled hills. Although the roadway seems relatively young, deep-set ruts hint at heavy carts traversing this route with surprising frequency. Fortified rest stops pepper the roadside, silent sentinels in the wild, several bearing the brutal scars of past attacks."

Similarly, as your adventurers approach the Sword Mountains, don’t limit the description to facts. Try this: "The landscape transforms dramatically as towering, jagged peaks capped with virgin snow thrust upwards from the lush, chaotic hills below. A testament to a turbulent history, abandoned fortresses dot the mountainsides, while evidence of beast lairs and old encampments sprawl across their ancient ruins."

## Implied Encounters and More

Beyond the allure of detailed descriptions, these narratives hint at potential encounters that might lie ahead. They stoke curiosity, enticing players to delve deeper, exploring the whispers of hidden treasures or mysteries tucked away within the folds of the world.

The heavy usage of the roadway to Phandalin implies significant commerce, but why are these rest stops fortified, and who or what attacked them? Those abandoned fortresses in the Sword Mountains – who built them, and why were they deserted? What kinds of creatures might inhabit these mountains now? Builing off of this concept, there are any number of ways a thoughtful GM might be able to incorporate suggestive descriptions into their terrain.  

Think about what a passing game trail that looks like a large creature barreled down it recently, was that creature chasing something or running from something?  What about thin trails of smoke suggesting small camps in the miles of wilderness surrounding the players?  Birds stirred up in the woods by something or absent altogether, a patch of landscape burned in the shape of a fan of flames or deep claw marks in a landing spot, fetishes hanging in the trees marking some territory or the remains of unfortunate travelers who might shared the parties fate?  These are all great ways to imply a story to be had in the area, build tension or suggest help, and give players more to think about between encounters.

By leaving these narrative hooks, you provide the players with a world that reacts and evolves around them. They may decide to investigate the fortified rest stops or seek out help from local tribes to explore those abandoned fortresses. Your players are no longer simply crossing a landscape – they're interacting with it, making decisions based on the environment and context you’ve provided.

## Conclusion

Geography in TTRPGs is not merely a backdrop or obstacle course but a world ripe with potential adventures. Shifting our narrative focus from straightforward descriptions to providing context and implied adventures allows players to experience the landscape in a much more immersive and dynamic way. The key lies in treating the geography as an integral part of your world's history and its future – a character in its own right with secrets to reveal, battles to recount, and adventures to offer. Your landscapes are not just set pieces; they're a canvas for countless stories waiting to unfold.

title: Dungeon of the Grieving Mind - Not Your Typical Dungeon!

Crafting dungeons that deeply resonate with the consequences of character choices? Now, that's what I call top-notch Dungeon Mastering in Dungeons and Dragons. Inspired by a spirited discussion over on Reddit, I've crafted the dungeon you're about to delve into. My hope? That you'll find it a thrilling addition to your campaign. The premise is versatile enough to slide right into numerous D&D storylines, whenever innocents have perished in the course of an adventure. An all too common occurrence in most campaigns.

**Setup**: Your players, in the thick of battle or perhaps a morally grey situation, have inadvertently caused the death of innocent bystanders. Little do they know, one of the fallen had a sibling: a devoted warlock bound to a mysterious fey from the [Shadowfell](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Shadowfell){:target="_blank"}. Recognizing the warlock's anguish, this fey bestows the dungeon you're about to explore as a "gift" to their loyal servant. Whether your players stumble upon it by sheer chance, through haunting dreams, or any other creative twist you fancy, is all up to you.

This small dungeon is set up assuming a party of 5th level characters but mix and match to your group’s needs.

**Dungeon Theme**: *A Grieving Mind* - The dungeon is a representation of the vengeful sibling’s psyche. Each section is a manifestation of his grief, anger, and quest for vengeance. This gives you the chance to use environmental dangers, narrative encounters, and emotional challenges instead of relying heavily on traps.

1. **Entrance - Mourning**: 
   * The entrance is surrounded by soft weeping echoes. Ghostly apparitions of the deceased peasant show their last moments, playing on a loop. 
   * **Enemies** - 5 [Shadows](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17010-shadow){:target="_blank"} (Yes, the CR is low but with the environmental effect I think it's fine. Particularly for the first encounter.)
   * **Environmental Hazard**: A fog slows movement by half, and characters must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw at the start of each round or be overwhelmed by feelings of guilt (disadvantage on attacks and checks).

2. **Second Chamber - Anger**: 
   * The large chamber pulses with a fiery rage. Walls appear to be made of burning embers, and the heat is stifling. A guttural sound of someone screaming in rage periodically emanates from a random location in the room where flame erupts.
   * **Enemies**: None
   * **Environmental Hazard**: A jagged and uneven chamber, the players must succeed on 3 DC 13 Athletics or Acrobatics checks to successfully cross the room.  Each failure results in 1d10 fire damage.

3. **Third Chamber - Reflection**: 
   * A vast underground lake where the surface acts as a mirror, showing each adventurer their reflection committing their worst mistakes or sins. The players must traverse a narrow stone pathway that sits just at the lakes water level.
   * **Enemies**: [Water Weird](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17208-water-weird){:target="_blank"} (see below)
   * **Encounter**: Each character sees their reflection in the surface of the water and is challenged by it, not as combatants but with questions and accusations, challenging their morals and decisions. If the character tries to respond and defend themselves, they must pass a DC 13 Persuasion check. For every 2 characters that either fail the check, or do not attempt to defend themselves, 1 Water Weird appears and tries to drag a character into the water and drown them. (min 1)

4. **Fourth Chamber - Descent into Madness**: 
   * A twisting labyrinth filled with whispering voices that doubt and belittle the adventurers, trying to make them doubt themselves. The environment and encounter are a recreation of whatever scene originally initiated this dungeon. For example, a party that fights a group of Kobolds but failed to stop them from sacrificing a group of peasants will encounter that scenario again.
   * **Enemies**: (Whatever enemy the group originally fought)
   * **Encounter**: The core of this encounter is for the players to relive the original encounter, this time randomly being transformed into the bystanders that lost their lives to realize the experience those people went through.  The characters have a hard time holding onto their sense of self. At the beginning of each round, the player must pass a DC 13 CHA save or be turned into a bystander for a round and are limited to the Commoners stat block.  If they are killed in this form, they return to their true self, prone on the ground, minus whatever damage they took, but can act normally.

5. **Final Chamber - Heart of Darkness**: 
   * The center of the sibling's grief. A blackened stone room where the shadow horror resides.
   * **Enemies**: Shadow Horror (use the [Oni](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16971-oni){:target="_blank"} stat-block), 2 [Shadow Demons](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17131-shadow-demon){:target="_blank"}.
   * **Encounter**: The sibling is there, having been transformed into a shadowy horror, a manifestation of their grief and desire for revenge turned into a dark entity. There is an opportunity for the DM to get creative here in how they want to end this, it should match whatever common theme is used in the campaign.  For example, upon being defeated the soul of the sibling rises and is confronted by the souls of their lost family who look at them with disappointment and grief as the siblings soul is dragged away to the Shadowfell by shadowy creatures.

That's it, with a bit of tweaking this is a simple adventure a DM could drop into almost any campaign.  Personally, I enjoy themed adventures that are a bit different and have a narrative undertone.  I hope you might find this useful as well.

Now get out there and run some great games.
