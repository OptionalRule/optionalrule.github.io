> ### Abilities
> **Innate Spellcasting (Psionics).** The Mind Reaver's innate spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 13). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no components:
>
> At will: *detect thoughts, levitate*
>
> 1/day each: *cause fear, sleep*
> 
> **Magic Resistance.** The Mind Reaver has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
> ### Actions
> **Tentacles.** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) psychic damage. If the target is Medium or smaller, it is grappled (escape DC 13) and must succeed on a DC 13 Intelligence saving throw or be stunned until this grapple ends. The Mind Reaver gains temporary hit points equal to the damage done to any creature that fails the Intelligence saving throw for being stunned.
>
> **Psychic Scream (Recharge 6).** The Mind Reaver emits psychic energy in a 30-foot radius. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 13 Intelligence saving throw or take 16 (3d8 + 3) psychic damage and be stunned for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
