> ### Abilities
> 
> **Keen Hearing and Smell.** The wolf has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell.
> 
> **Pack Tactics.** The wolf has advantage on attack rolls against a creature if at least one of the wolf's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't incapacitated.
> 
> **Relentless (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).** If the wolf takes damage that would reduce it to 0 hit points, it is reduced to 1 hit point instead.
>
> **Nimble Predator.** The wolf doesn't provoke opportunity attacks from prone creatures when it moves out of their reach.
>
> **Leader of the Hunt.** When the Dire Wolf Alpha knocks a target prone with a bite attack, any allies within 5 feet of the prone creature, who have temporary hit points, may make a single attack as a reaction.
> 
> ### Actions
> 
> **Multiattack.** The wolf makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its claws.
> 
> **Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage, and the target has the Prone condition if it is Huge or smaller.
> 
> **Claws.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 9 (2d4 + 4) slashing damage.
> 
> **Howl of the Pack (1/Day).** The wolf lets out a chilling howl. Each allied wolf within 60 feet of this wolf that can hear it gains 10 temporary hit points and advantage on attack rolls until the start of the Dire Wolf Alpha's next turn.
