### Pale Flame Revenant
 Formerly esteemed knights of the Church of the Silver Flame, these tormented spirits fell prey to a hidden voice within the Flame itself, which spurred them into ruthless acts of purges and violence. Now trapped in an undead state, the Pale Flame Revenants have lost all vestiges of their once noble identities, compelled by a relentless desire for retribution against the living. Their spectral existence is a chilling testament to the tragic results of corruption intertwining with zealotry, forever marring their sacred commitment.

> **Undead Fortitude.** If damage reduces the zombie to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is fire, celestial, or from a critical hit. On a success, the zombie drops to 1 hit point instead.
>
> **Death Throes.** When a pale flame revenant dies, its body is consumed by an intense silvery flame.  Any creature in the same space must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 8 (2d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  The fire ignites flammable objects in this space that aren't being worn or carried, and it destroys the revenant and any items it carried, leaving nothing but fine ash.
